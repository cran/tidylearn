#' Call a model-frame fitting function with arguments that are values
#'
#' \code{lm()}, \code{glm()} and \code{rpart()} evaluate \code{weights},
#' \code{subset} and \code{offset} inside the data, with the formula's
#' environment as the fallback. Forwarded through \code{...} that lookup
#' fails with "..1 used in an incorrect context", and a local variable is
#' not in the formula's environment either. \code{do.call()} places the
#' values themselves in the call, which is what those functions can
#' evaluate.
#'
#' The stored call then holds every value literally, so \code{print()} on
#' the fit would spill the whole frame and weight vector. The data, case
#' weights, subset and control list are held by \code{tl_hold_call_args()}
#' instead, and the function name replaces the function object.
#' \code{family} is left to the caller: as a bare symbol it resolves to
#' \code{stats::family()} when \code{update()} or \code{step()} re-runs the
#' call.
#'
#' A vector \code{offset} is refused. It would fit, but \code{predict()}
#' evaluates the stored \code{offset} in the new data, finds
#' \code{stats::offset()} and fails. Only \code{lm()} and \code{glm()} apply
#' an \code{offset()} term of the formula at prediction, so only their
#' refusal points there; the other functions routed here would drop it.
