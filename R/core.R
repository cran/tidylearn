#' @title tidylearn: A Unified Tidy Interface to R's Machine Learning Ecosystem
#' @name tidylearn-core
#' @description Core functionality for tidylearn. This package
#'   provides a unified tidyverse-compatible interface to
#'   established R machine learning packages including glmnet,
#'   randomForest, xgboost, e1071, rpart, gbm, nnet, cluster,
#'   and dbscan. The underlying algorithms are unchanged -
#'   tidylearn wraps them with consistent function signatures,
#'   tidy tibble output, and unified ggplot2-based
#'   visualization. Supervised models keep the wrapped object at
#'   model$fit; unsupervised ones put it at model$fit$model,
#'   alongside the tidied components.

#' Create a tidylearn model
#'
#' Unified interface for creating machine learning models
#' by wrapping established R packages. This function dispatches
#' to the appropriate underlying package based on the method.
#'
#' The wrapped packages include: stats (lm, glm, prcomp,
#' kmeans, hclust), glmnet, randomForest, xgboost, gbm,
#' e1071, nnet, rpart, cluster, and dbscan. The underlying
#' algorithms are unchanged - this function provides a
#' consistent interface and returns tidy output.
#'
#' For a supervised method, \code{model$fit} is the object the wrapped
#' function returned. An unsupervised method returns tidied components as
#' well, so the wrapped object sits at \code{model$fit$model} and
#' \code{model$fit} is the list holding both.
#'
#' For classification, the response is reduced to the classes it
#' actually contains: subsetting a data frame keeps every factor level,
#' and a level no row uses would otherwise be reported as a class, given
#' its own (zero) probability column, and counted when deciding whether
#' the problem is binary. The fit is unaffected.
#'
#' Whether a supervised model is a classification or a regression is
#' decided by the response the formula computes, so \code{factor(cyl) ~ wt}
#' is a classification even though \code{cyl} is numeric. A factor or text
#' response is a classification. A logical response is a regression for
#' every method but \code{"logistic"} -- with \code{"linear"}, a linear
#' probability model -- so write \code{factor(y) ~ ...} to classify it.
#'
#' A categorical predictor stored as text, as \code{tl_read()} returns it,
#' is made a factor before the fit and stored as one in \code{$data}, so
#' every method treats it as a category. At \code{predict()}, categorical
#' columns in new data are read against the levels seen in training: new
#' data may hold only some of them, and a level the model was not trained
#' on is an error that names the column.
#'
#' @section Method arguments:
#' Arguments in \code{...} are passed to the function the method wraps,
#' except for these, which tidylearn takes itself:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{"polynomial"}}{\code{degree} (default 2). Each numeric main
#'     effect is replaced by \code{poly(term, degree, raw = TRUE)} and the
#'     result fitted with \code{lm()}. A numeric term is one that computes a
#'     numeric vector, such as \code{wt} or \code{log(wt)}, or a one-column
#'     matrix, such as \code{scale(wt)}. One that is also part of an
#'     interaction keeps its own term and gains \code{I(x^2)} up to
#'     \code{I(x^degree)}, so the interaction is coded as written. Factor
#'     and other non-numeric terms, interactions, \code{I()} terms, bases
#'     such as \code{poly()} or a spline's, the response as written, an
#'     \code{offset()} and a removed intercept are kept as they are.}
#'   \item{\code{"ridge"}, \code{"lasso"}, \code{"elastic_net"}}{
#'     \code{alpha}, glmnet's mixing parameter (by default 0, 1 and 0.5);
#'     \code{lambda}, a single penalty to fit at, a sequence of penalties for
#'     \code{glmnet::cv.glmnet()} to choose from, or \code{NULL} (the
#'     default) to let it choose its own; and \code{cv_folds} (default 5),
#'     the number of folds for that cross-validation, which takes the place
#'     of glmnet's \code{nfolds}. \code{predict()} uses the \code{lambda.1se}
#'     penalty. tidylearn sets \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{family} and
#'     \code{nfolds} itself and refuses them, along with any argument glmnet
#'     does not take.}
#'   \item{\code{"svm"}}{\code{tune} (default \code{FALSE}) and
#'     \code{tune_folds} (default 5), to choose \code{cost} by
#'     cross-validation before the fit, with \code{gamma} for a non-linear
#'     kernel and \code{degree} for a polynomial one.}
#'   \item{\code{"deep"}}{\code{hidden_layers}, \code{activation},
#'     \code{dropout}, \code{epochs}, \code{batch_size},
#'     \code{validation_split} and \code{learning_rate}.}
#'   \item{\code{"pca"}}{\code{scale} and \code{center} (both \code{TRUE}).}
#'   \item{\code{"mds"}}{\code{mds_method}, the variant:
#'     \code{"classical"} (the default, \code{stats::cmdscale()}),
#'     \code{"metric"} or \code{"nonmetric"} (smacof), or \code{"sammon"}
#'     or \code{"kruskal"} (MASS). \code{k}, or its alias \code{ndim}, is
#'     the number of dimensions (default 2).}
#'   \item{\code{"kmeans"}, \code{"pam"}, \code{"clara"}}{\code{k}, the
#'     number of clusters (default 3); for \code{"pam"}, \code{metric}
#'     as well (default \code{"euclidean"}).}
#'   \item{\code{"hclust"}}{\code{hclust_method}, the linkage:
#'     \code{"average"} (the default), \code{"ward.D"}, \code{"ward.D2"},
#'     \code{"single"}, \code{"complete"}, \code{"mcquitty"},
#'     \code{"median"} or \code{"centroid"}; and \code{distance} (default
#'     \code{"euclidean"}).}
#'   \item{\code{"dbscan"}}{\code{eps} (default 0.5), \code{minPts}
#'     (default 5) and \code{distance} (default \code{"euclidean"}).}
#' }
#' Some defaults differ from the wrapped function's: \code{"forest"} computes
#' importance (\code{importance = TRUE}), \code{"boost"} grows trees of
#' \code{interaction.depth = 3}, and \code{"nn"} fits \code{size = 5}
#' hidden units with \code{trace = FALSE}.
#'
#' \code{weights} and \code{subset} take values, one per row of
#' \code{data} (such as \code{weights = data$w}), not column names. A
#' \code{subset} is applied before the fit, and \code{$data} holds only
#' the rows it selects. Case weights are applied by every supervised method
#' except \code{"svm"} and \code{"deep"}, which refuse them. An offset,
#' written as \code{offset()} in the formula, is applied by
#' \code{"linear"}, \code{"polynomial"} and \code{"logistic"}; the other
#' methods refuse one, because their \code{predict()} would not add it
#' back.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing the training data
#' @param formula A formula specifying the model. For
#'   unsupervised methods, use \code{~ vars} or NULL; a one-sided formula
#'   names columns, and \code{~ . - x} means every numeric column but
#'   \code{x}. Supervised methods need a two-sided formula.
#' @param method The modeling method. Supervised: "linear"
#'   (stats::lm), "polynomial" (stats::lm on polynomial terms),
#'   "logistic" (stats::glm), "tree" (rpart),
#'   "forest" (randomForest), "boost" (gbm),
#'   "ridge"/"lasso"/"elastic_net" (glmnet), "svm" (e1071),
#'   "nn" (nnet), "deep" (keras), "xgboost" (xgboost).
#'   The method and the response have to agree, and a mismatch is an
#'   error rather than a meaningless fit: \code{"linear"} and
#'   \code{"polynomial"} need a numeric response, \code{"logistic"}
#'   needs exactly two classes, and every other supervised method takes
#'   either.
#'   Unsupervised: "pca" (stats::prcomp),
#'   "mds" (stats::cmdscale, or smacof or MASS through \code{mds_method}),
#'   "kmeans" (stats::kmeans), "pam"/"clara" (cluster),
#'   "hclust" (stats::hclust), "dbscan" (dbscan).
#' @param compute Compute tier for the fit. One of \code{"cpu"} (default,
#'   existing behaviour), \code{"gpu"} (route to local CUDA when the
#'   method has an upstream GPU path -- xgboost and deep learning today),
#'   \code{"auto"} (consult \code{\link{tl_compute_advisor}} and pick per
#'   call), or \code{"cloud"} (reserved -- not yet wired up). When
#'   \code{"gpu"} is requested for a method without an upstream GPU path
#'   or on a machine without a detected GPU, the call falls back to CPU
#'   with a warning.
#' @param ... Arguments for the method: see the Method arguments section.
#'   Anything else is passed to the underlying model function.
#' @return A \code{tidylearn_model} object (S3) containing the fitted model
#'   (\code{$fit}, or \code{$fit$model} for an unsupervised method),
#'   model specification (\code{$spec}), and training data
#'   (\code{$data}). \code{update()} and \code{step()} on \code{$fit}
#'   refit on the training rows and weights, whatever is in the calling
#'   environment. The object also inherits from a method-specific class
#'   (e.g., \code{tidylearn_linear}) and a paradigm class
#'   (\code{tidylearn_supervised} or \code{tidylearn_unsupervised}).

#'
#' Unified prediction interface for both supervised and unsupervised models
#'
#' @param object A tidylearn model object
#' @param new_data A data frame containing the new data.
#'   If NULL, uses training data.
#' @param type Type of prediction, for supervised models only:
#'   \code{"response"} (default), \code{"prob"} or \code{"class"}. Note
#'   that \code{"response"} is method-dependent -- logistic regression
#'   returns probabilities, trees and forests return class labels -- so
#'   pass \code{"class"} explicitly when you want labels. \code{"prob"}
#'   and \code{"class"} need a classification model, and any other value
#'   is an error. Ignored by unsupervised models, whose output is
#'   determined by the method.
#' @param ... Additional arguments
#' @return For supervised models, a \link[tibble]{tibble} with a
#'   \code{.pred} column; with \code{type = "prob"}, one column per class
#'   instead. It has one row per row of \code{new_data}, in order, and
#'   zero rows for zero-row \code{new_data}. For unsupervised models, the
#'   method's natural output: an \code{.obs_id} column, the row names of
#'   the data predicted on, plus component scores for \code{"pca"} and
#'   \code{"mds"} (as many as the model keeps), or plus a \code{cluster}
#'   column for the clustering methods.
#'
#'   Unsupervised models differ in whether they can handle new data.
#'   \code{"pca"} projects it and \code{"kmeans"} assigns it to the
#'   nearest centre; \code{"pam"}, \code{"clara"}, \code{"dbscan"},
#'   \code{"mds"} and \code{"hclust"} have no out-of-sample projection
#'   and error if \code{new_data} is supplied. For hierarchical
#'   clustering, cut the tree with \code{tidy_cutree()} instead.
