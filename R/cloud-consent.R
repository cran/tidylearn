# Session-level consent lock. Deliberately an environment in the package
# namespace and nothing else: not an option, not a file, not a cached
# credential. It dies with the R session (T2).

# Hosts added this session with tl_cloud_allow_host(). Kept here for the
# same reason as the consent lock: session-scoped, never persisted.
.tl_cloud_state$extra_hosts <- character(0)

# In-flight cloud jobs, keyed by Modal call id, so that a submitted job
# is never invisible. See tl_cloud_jobs(). Session-scoped like the rest:
# a job outlives this registry, which is exactly why the timeout set at
# submission is the control that matters.

#' Grant or revoke cloud upload consent for this R session
#'
#' Fitting with `compute = "cloud"` uploads your training data to your
#' own Modal account, which is a third party. tidylearn will not do that
#' without explicit consent on every call.
#'
#' There are two ways to give it. Pass `confirm_upload = TRUE` to each
#' `tl_model()` call, or call `tl_cloud_consent()` once to opt in for the
#' rest of the session. The session lock exists for batch and
#' non-interactive work, where a per-call argument is repetitive.
#'
#' The lock is **not** persisted. It is forgotten when the R session
#' ends, and it is never written to disk. Revoke it early with
#' `tl_cloud_consent(FALSE)`.
#'
#' tidylearn never prompts interactively for consent, so scripts, CI and
#' `Rscript` behave the same as an interactive session.
#'
#' @param consent `TRUE` to allow cloud uploads for the rest of the
#'   session, `FALSE` to revoke.
#' @return The previous consent state, invisibly.

#'   `system.file("security/threat-model.md", package = "tidylearn")`.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' # Opt in for the session, then revoke.
