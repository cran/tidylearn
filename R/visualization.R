#' Plot feature importance across multiple models
#'
#' Each model's importance is rescaled on its own: its largest value
#' becomes 100, or, when no value is positive (a forest's permutation
#' importance can be negative throughout), its largest magnitude becomes
#' -100. A factor predictor
#' appears once, under its own name, for every model: the largest of its
#' design columns stands for it where a method ranks those columns
#' separately (ridge, lasso, elastic net and xgboost). A predictor a model
#' was given but did not use scores zero for that model; one it was never
#' given has no bar for it. Tree, forest and boost models are given the
#' variables of an interaction such as \code{wt:hp} rather than the
#' interaction itself, so it has no bar for them. Features are ranked on
#' their mean importance over the models that were given them.
