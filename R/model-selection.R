#' Perform stepwise selection on a linear model
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing the training data
#' @param formula A formula specifying the initial model
#' @param direction Direction of stepwise selection:
#'   "forward", "backward", or "both"
#' @param criterion Criterion for selection: "AIC" or "BIC"
#' @param trace Logical; whether to print progress
#' @param steps Maximum number of steps to take
#' @param ... Additional arguments to pass to step()
#' @return A \code{tidylearn_model} object of class
#'   \code{tidylearn_linear} wrapping the selected \code{\link[stats]{lm}}
#'   model. Access the underlying model via \code{$fit} and the selected
#'   formula via \code{$spec$formula}. \code{$data} is the data passed in.
#' @details Every candidate model is fitted on the same rows: those with no
#'   missing value in any variable of \code{formula}. When that leaves out
#'   rows a candidate could otherwise use, a message gives the count, and
#'   the fit records the rows in its \code{na.action}, as \code{lm()}
#'   records the rows it drops itself.
#'
#'   Forward and both-direction selection start from a model holding the
#'   intercept, or none if \code{formula} removes it with \code{- 1}, and
#'   any \code{offset()} terms in \code{formula}. Neither is ever dropped.

#' built by \code{\link{tl_semisupervised}} or \code{\link{tl_anomaly_aware}},
#' or one of \code{\link{tl_auto_ml}}'s candidates fitted on features it
#' engineered.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing the training data
#' @param models A named list of supervised tidylearn models, all of them
#'   classification or all regression. An unnamed model is named
#'   \code{Model_<position>}.
#' @param folds Number of cross-validation folds, a whole number between 2
#'   and \code{nrow(data)}. \code{nrow(data)} leaves each row out in turn,
#'   and each fold then scores a single prediction. \code{"accuracy"},
#'   \code{"mae"}, \code{"mse"} and \code{"mape"} average to their values
#'   over the left-out predictions. The average \code{"rmse"} is the mean
#'   absolute error; \code{"precision"}, \code{"recall"},
#'   \code{"sensitivity"}, \code{"specificity"} and \code{"f1"} are
#'   undefined on the folds whose one row gives them nothing to divide by;
#'   and \code{"rsq"}, \code{"auc"} and \code{"pr_auc"} are undefined on
#'   every fold. A run scoring any of these warns once.
#' @param metrics Character vector of metrics to compute, from those
#'   \code{\link{tl_evaluate}} computes for the task. Defaults to
#'   \code{c("accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f1", "auc")} for
#'   classification and \code{c("rmse", "mae", "rsq", "mape")} for
#'   regression.
#' @param ... Arguments passed to \code{\link{tl_model}} for every fold
#'   fit. Each model is refitted with the arguments it was built with;
#'   anything given here overrides them.
#' @return A list with two elements:

#'     \item{\code{$fold_metrics}}{A data frame with columns
#'       \code{metric}, \code{value}, \code{fold}, and \code{model}

#'       on a fold -- \code{"auc"} on a fold holding one class -- is
#'       \code{NA} there, and so is every metric of a fold none of whose
#'       rows can be scored, with a warning naming the fold.}
#'     \item{\code{$summary}}{A data frame with columns \code{model},

#'   the mean of those paired differences. With fewer than two such folds
#'   the p-values are \code{NA}, with a warning.
