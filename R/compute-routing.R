#' Resolve the effective compute tier for a tidylearn fit
#'
#' Internal plumbing called from `tl_model_supervised()` (and any future
#' direct fit entry points) to validate the user's `compute` argument,
#' consult the advisor when `compute = "auto"`, and apply the documented
#' fallback rules:
#'
#' * `compute = "gpu"` for a method without an upstream GPU path -> warn
#'   and fall back to `"cpu"`.
#' * `compute = "gpu"` when no GPU-capable backend is detected -> warn
#'   and fall back to `"cpu"`.
#' * `compute = "cloud"` -> error (not yet wired up).
#'
#' Returns one of `"cpu"` or `"gpu"`.
