# Hosts tidylearn is willing to send user data to by default. Deployed
# Modal Web Functions live under *.modal.run; modal.com covers Modal's
# own API hosts. Any Modal workspace's endpoint matches *.modal.run, not
# only the user's own. Modal customers on custom domains can add to this
# with tl_cloud_allow_host(), which is a deliberate per-session action --
# see T9 in inst/security/threat-model.md.

#' Rejects anything that is not a bare host: URLs, ports, paths,
#' wildcards, empty labels, and names of fewer than three labels. A
#' single label such as `"com"` would widen the allowlist to an entire
#' TLD, and two labels can be a public suffix such as `"co.uk"` or
#' `"github.io"`, under which anyone can register a site; either defeats
#' T9. tidylearn has no copy of the Public Suffix List, so the label
#' count is the rule: it refuses every two-label suffix, and a longer
#' public suffix still passes.
#'
#' The trailing dot of a fully qualified name (`"fits.example.com."`) is
#' dropped: an endpoint's host never carries it, so a host stored with it
#' would match nothing.

#' tidylearn uploads training data only to Modal's own hosts
#' (`*.modal.run`, `*.modal.com`). Modal customers serving Web Functions
#' from a custom domain can add that domain here.
#'
#' This widens the set of destinations your data may be sent to, so it
#' is deliberately a per-session call rather than an option or an
#' environment variable: a shared `.Rprofile` or an inherited environment
#' should not be able to add a destination without you writing the call.
#' Additions are never persisted and are forgotten when the session ends.
#'
#' Hosts match themselves and their subdomains. Adding
#' `"fits.example.com"` accepts `https://fits.example.com` and
#' `https://a.fits.example.com`, and nothing else.
#'
#' Give the endpoint's full host name. A name of fewer than three labels,
