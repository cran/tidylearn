# ---- Cloud round trip: fitted models must survive serialisation ----
#
# `compute = "cloud"` fits on a remote R worker and ships the fitted model
# back as raw bytes. A model whose internals are an external pointer
# (xgboost) or a handle to a Python object (keras) can deserialise into an
# object that looks fine but cannot predict, so the round trip is asserted
# per method rather than assumed.
#
# `unserialize(serialize(x))` in one process is a genuine check here because
# the byte stream is self-contained -- see the payload-size test at the end
# of this file. If a backend ever stopped embedding its model in the stream,
# the restored object would carry a dangling pointer and predict() would
# fail, which is exactly what these tests catch.
