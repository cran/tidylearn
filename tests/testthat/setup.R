# Fitting a keras model makes TensorFlow write autograph tracing files
# and a __pycache__ directory, and leaves them there. On a machine with
# a TensorFlow backend installed that is upwards of a hundred files per
# run, which R CMD check reports as "detritus in the temp directory".
# CRAN never sees it -- there is no backend there, so those tests skip
# -- but a maintainer running a local check does. Our tests create the
# files, so our tests remove them.
#
# They land in Python's tempfile.gettempdir(), which is the TMPDIR root
# -- NOT R's session tempdir(), which is a subdirectory of it that R
# removes on exit anyway. Cleaning the wrong one silently does nothing.
#
# Only files that appear during this run are removed, so a concurrent
# process's files are left alone.
