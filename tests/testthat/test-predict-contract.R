# Every supervised method has to satisfy the same predict() contract.
#
# Testing one representative method per feature is what let six methods
# ship with a broken predict(): gbm was only ever fitted on a two-class
# response, so its 3-D multinomial array was never seen; SVM appeared
# only as a tuning target, so predict() was never called on it at all;
# and xgboost was never asked to score data without the response column,
# which is the ordinary production case.
#
# So drive every method through the same grid instead: binary and
# multiclass and regression, one row and many, with and without the
# response column present, and with a missing predictor value.

# Methods backed by packages tidylearn imports, so they always run.
# "deep" is excluded deliberately -- it needs a keras backend, which is
# not available on CRAN or in CI. xgboost is in Suggests, so it joins the
# grid only when installed.
