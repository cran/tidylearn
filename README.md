## Overview

`tidylearn` provides a **unified tidyverse-compatible interface** to R's machine
learning ecosystem. It wraps proven packages like glmnet, randomForest,
xgboost, e1071, cluster, and dbscan - you get the reliability of established
implementations with the convenience of a consistent, tidy API.

**What tidylearn does:**

- Reads data from diverse sources (`tl_read()`) — CSV, Excel, Parquet,
  JSON, databases, S3, Kaggle, and more
- Provides one consistent interface (`tl_model()`) to 20 ML algorithms
  (13 supervised, 7 unsupervised)
- Returns tidy tibbles instead of varied output formats
- Offers unified ggplot2-based visualization and formatted `gt` tables
- Enables pipe-friendly workflows with `|>`
- Orchestrates complex workflows combining multiple techniques

**What tidylearn is NOT:**

- A reimplementation of ML algorithms (uses established packages under the hood)
- A replacement for the underlying packages (you can access the raw model via
  `model$fit`, or `model$fit$model` for an unsupervised method)

## Why tidylearn?

Each ML package in R has its own API, output format, and conventions. tidylearn
provides a translation layer so you can:

| Without tidylearn                     | With tidylearn           |
| ------------------------------------- | -----------------------  |
| Learn different APIs for each package | One API for everything   |
| Write custom code to extract results  | Consistent tibble output |
| Create different plots for each model | Unified visualization    |
| Manage package-specific quirks        | Focus on your analysis   |

The underlying algorithms are unchanged - tidylearn simply makes them easier to
use together.

## Installation

```r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidylearn")

# Or install development version from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("ces0491/tidylearn")
```

## Quick Start

### Data Ingestion

`tl_read()` auto-detects the format and returns a tidy `tidylearn_data` object:

```r
library(tidylearn)

# Single files — format auto-detected from extension
data <- tl_read("sales.csv")
data <- tl_read("results.xlsx", sheet = "Q1")
data <- tl_read("experiment.parquet")

# Databases
data <- tl_read_sqlite("warehouse.sqlite", "SELECT * FROM sales")
data <- tl_read_postgres("localhost", query = "SELECT * FROM customers",
                         dbname = "analytics", user = "me")

# Cloud and API sources
data <- tl_read_s3("s3://my-bucket/data.csv")
data <- tl_read_kaggle("zillow/zecon", file = "Zip_time_series.csv")

# Multi-file reading
data <- tl_read(c("jan.csv", "feb.csv", "mar.csv"))
data <- tl_read_dir("data/monthly/", format = "csv")
data <- tl_read_zip("download.zip")
```

### Unified Interface

A single `tl_model()` function dispatches to the appropriate underlying package:

```r
library(tidylearn)

# Classification -> uses randomForest::randomForest()
model <- tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "forest")

# Regression -> uses stats::lm()
model <- tl_model(mtcars, mpg ~ wt + hp, method = "linear")

# Regularization -> uses glmnet::glmnet()
model <- tl_model(mtcars, mpg ~ ., method = "lasso")

# Clustering -> uses stats::kmeans()
model <- tl_model(iris[,1:4], method = "kmeans", k = 3)

# PCA -> uses stats::prcomp()
model <- tl_model(iris[,1:4], method = "pca")
```

### Tidy Output

All results come back as tibbles, ready for dplyr and ggplot2:

```r
# Predictions come back as a tibble with a .pred column
predictions <- predict(model, new_data = test_data)

# Metrics as tibbles - pick the metrics you want
metrics <- tl_evaluate(model, test_data)
metrics <- tl_evaluate(model, test_data, metrics = c("rmse", "rsq"))

# Coefficients too, with a confidence interval when you ask for one
coefs <- tl_coefficients(model)
coefs <- tl_coefficients(model, conf_int = TRUE, level = 0.9)

# Easy to pipe
model |>
  predict(new_data = test_data) |>
  bind_cols(test_data) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = mpg, y = .pred)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0)
```

For classification, what `.pred` holds depends on `type`: `"class"` gives
labels, `"prob"` gives one column per class. The default `"response"` varies
by method - probabilities for logistic regression, labels for trees and
forests - so pass `type` explicitly, or let `tl_evaluate()` handle it.

### Access the Underlying Model

You always have access to the raw model from the underlying package:

```r
model <- tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "forest")

# Access the randomForest object directly
model$fit  # This is the randomForest::randomForest() result

# Use package-specific functions if needed
randomForest::varImpPlot(model$fit)
```

## Wrapped Packages

tidylearn provides a unified interface to these established R packages:

### Supervised Learning

| Method | Underlying Package | Function Called |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| `"linear"` | stats | `lm()` |
| `"polynomial"` | stats | `lm()` with `poly()` |
| `"logistic"` | stats | `glm(..., family = binomial)` |
| `"ridge"`, `"lasso"`, `"elastic_net"` | glmnet | `glmnet()` |
| `"tree"` | rpart | `rpart()` |
| `"forest"` | randomForest | `randomForest()` |
| `"boost"` | gbm | `gbm()` |
| `"xgboost"` | xgboost | `xgb.train()` |
| `"svm"` | e1071 | `svm()` |
| `"nn"` | nnet | `nnet()` |
| `"deep"` | keras | `keras_model_sequential()` |

`"logistic"` requires a two-level response and errors on anything else.
Every other classification method here handles more than two classes.

### Unsupervised Learning

| Method | Underlying Package | Function Called |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `"pca"` | stats | `prcomp()` |
| `"mds"` | stats, MASS, smacof | `cmdscale()`, `isoMDS()`, etc. |
| `"kmeans"` | stats | `kmeans()` |
| `"pam"` | cluster | `pam()` |
| `"clara"` | cluster | `clara()` |
| `"hclust"` | stats | `hclust()` |
| `"dbscan"` | dbscan | `dbscan()` |

## Integration Workflows

Beyond wrapping individual packages, tidylearn provides orchestration functions
that combine multiple techniques:

### Dimensionality Reduction + Supervised Learning

```r
# Reduce dimensions before classification
reduced <- tl_reduce_dimensions(iris, response = "Species",
                                method = "pca", n_components = 3)
model <- tl_model(reduced$data, Species ~ ., method = "forest")
```

### Cluster-Based Feature Engineering

```r
# Add cluster membership as a feature
enriched <- tl_add_cluster_features(data, response = "target",
                                    method = "kmeans", k = 3)
model <- tl_model(enriched, target ~ ., method = "forest")
```

### Semi-Supervised Learning

```r
# Use clustering to propagate labels to unlabeled data
model <- tl_semisupervised(data, target ~ .,
                          labeled_indices = labeled_idx,
                          cluster_method = "kmeans")
```

### AutoML

```r
# Automatically try multiple approaches
result <- tl_auto_ml(data, target ~ .,
                    time_budget = 300)
result$leaderboard
```

## Compute Backends

Most methods run on the CPU and need no thought. For the two with an
upstream GPU path (`"xgboost"` and `"deep"`), `tl_model()` takes a
`compute` argument:

```r
# Check what this machine can actually do
tl_check_gpu()

# Route a fit to the local GPU (falls back to CPU with a warning if
# no CUDA-capable backend is detected)
model <- tl_model(data, y ~ ., method = "xgboost", compute = "gpu")

# Let tidylearn decide per call
model <- tl_model(data, y ~ ., method = "xgboost", compute = "auto")
```

`tl_compute_advisor()` estimates runtime, peak memory and cost across
local CPU, local GPU and cloud tiers before you commit to a long fit:

```r
tl_compute_advisor("xgboost", data, y ~ ., hyperparams = list(nrounds = 5000))
```

Estimates are order-of-magnitude. The advisor covers all 13 supervised
methods, and it treats cloud as a "does not fit on my machine" tier, so it
will recommend cloud for a CPU-only method like random forest if the job is
RAM-infeasible locally.

### Cloud compute

**`compute = "cloud"` is not executable yet** and errors if you ask for
it. The cloud tier is reported by the advisor for planning only.

What is in place is the safety model, which lands before any code that
could transmit data. Cloud fits will upload your training data to your
own Modal account - a third party - so tidylearn will not do it without
explicit consent, and will not send it anywhere except a host you have
allowed:

```r
# Consent, per call or for the session. Never persisted, never prompted
# for interactively, so scripts and CI behave like an interactive session
tl_cloud_consent()
tl_cloud_consent(FALSE)   # revoke

# The endpoint comes from an environment variable, and must be https on
# a Modal host. A typo or a wrong host errors
Sys.setenv(TIDYLEARN_MODAL_ENDPOINT = "https://you--tidylearn-fit.modal.run")

# Modal customers on a custom domain can add it, per session
tl_cloud_allow_host("fits.example.com")
tl_cloud_allowed_hosts()
```

### Cost controls

A job submitted to Modal runs to completion there whatever your R session
does afterwards. Ctrl-C, a closed IDE, a crashed session and a closed
laptop all leave it running and billing, because the session was only
polling for a result.

The bound on spend therefore cannot live in R. Every submission carries an
explicit timeout, derived from the estimate with headroom and capped well
below Modal's 24-hour maximum, and the worker runs with retries off so a
hung job cannot bill several timeouts over.

What you are asked to accept before a fit is the **worst case** - the
timeout at the tier's rate. The estimate is order-of-magnitude, and the
timeout is what actually binds:

```r
# Refused before anything is uploaded if the worst case exceeds max_cost,
# or if the estimate is so large the job would be killed before finishing
model <- tl_model(data, y ~ ., method = "xgboost", compute = "cloud",
                  confirm_upload = TRUE, max_cost = 5)

# Anything currently running, so no job is invisible
tl_cloud_jobs()
```

Set a spend budget on your Modal workspace as well. That is the only true
hard cap, and it is not tidylearn's to set.

The full contract - what cloud compute will and will not do, with an
audit checklist - ships with the package:

```r
file.show(system.file("security/threat-model.md", package = "tidylearn"))
```

## Unified Visualization

ggplot2-based plotting for most model types:

```r
# Generic plot method works for all model types
plot(forest_model)       # Automatic visualization based on model type
plot(linear_model)       # Actual vs predicted for regression
plot(pca_model)          # Variance explained for PCA
plot(kmeans_model)       # Cluster scatter plot
plot(hclust_model)       # Dendrogram, drawn with base graphics

# The lower-level helpers take data frames rather than models
plot_clusters(cluster_data, cluster_col = "cluster")
plot_variance_explained(pca_model$fit$variance_explained)

# Interactive dashboard for detailed exploration
tl_dashboard(model, test_data)
```

## Formatted Tables

The `tl_table()` family produces formatted `gt` tables for reporting:

```r
# Auto-selects the best table type
tl_table(model)

# Specific table types
tl_table_metrics(model, new_data = test_data)
tl_table_coefficients(model)
tl_table_confusion(model, new_data = test_data)
tl_table_importance(model)

# Compare models side-by-side
tl_table_comparison(model1, model2, model3,
                    new_data = test_data,
                    names = c("Linear", "Forest", "XGBoost"))
```

`gt` is a suggested dependency, so these need it installed. The numbers
behind the coefficient table are available without it through
`tl_coefficients()`.

## Philosophy

The underlying packages do the real work, and tidylearn does not hide what
they are doing — every method documents the function it calls, and a
supervised model's `$fit` is the object that function returned (an
unsupervised one keeps it at `$fit$model`, next to the tidied components).
What tidylearn adds is one signature across all 20 methods, and predictions,
metrics and most plots that are already tibbles or ggplot2 objects, so
results move into dplyr and the rest of the tidyverse without conversion.
