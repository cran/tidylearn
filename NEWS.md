# tidylearn 0.6.0

## Breaking Changes

* tidylearn requires R 4.1.0 or later. The package, its README and the
  vignettes use the native `|>` pipe, which R 3.6 and 4.0 cannot parse.
  magrittr's `%>%` is still re-exported, so existing code that pipes
  with it after `library(tidylearn)` keeps working.

* tidylearn requires ggplot2 3.4.0 or later. The plots set line widths
  with the `linewidth` aesthetic, which ggplot2 3.3 ignores with an
  unknown-parameter warning and draws at the default width. The rlang
  floor rises from 0.4.0 to 1.0.0, the version ggplot2 3.4.0 imports, so
  it changes nothing for an install that meets the ggplot2 one.

* Some calls that ran in 0.5.0 are now errors, with a message naming
  the problem: each passed an argument tidylearn ignored or returned a
  meaningless result. Bug Fixes describes all of them. Among them are:
  * an argument a method cannot use, such as `maxdeth = 1` or
    `offset =` with `method = "tree"`, a name glmnet does not take with
    `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` or `"elastic_net"`, and a misspelt argument to
    `tl_pipeline()`;
  * an `offset()` term with a method that cannot apply it at
    `predict()`, which is every method but `"linear"`, `"polynomial"`
    and `"logistic"`;
  * a metric name `tl_evaluate()` or `tl_cv()` does not compute, such
    as `"RMSE"`;
  * `predict(type = "prob")` or `type = "class"` on a regression
    model, and a misspelt `type`;
  * `tl_prepare_data(impute_method = "knn")`, and `tl_split()` with a
    `prop` outside (0, 1);
  * repeated model names in `tl_compare_cv()` and
    `tl_plot_importance_comparison()`;
  * `type` in `tl_plot_interaction()`, and an `exclude_vars` in
    `tl_auto_interactions()` that is not a predictor;
  * a numeric response in `tl_semisupervised()`, and
    `tl_anomaly_aware(action = "downweight")` with `"svm"` or `"deep"`.

* `tl_model()` makes a text predictor a factor before fitting, and
  stores it as one in `$data`. `method = "forest"` coded a character
  column as numbers by the values present in whichever frame it was
  handed, so a row's prediction depended on the rows scored with it: on
  a 120-row frame drawn after `set.seed(7)`, in which group `"c"` sits
  near 10, three `"c"` rows scored alone predicted -0.11, -0.15 and
  0.45, and 9.47, 9.26 and 9.78 inside the full frame. A forest now
  splits on the column as a category, so its fitted values change, and
  a text column with more than 53 distinct values is refused by
  randomForest ("Can not handle categorical predictors with more than
  53 categories"); exclude identifiers with `y ~ . - id`.
  `method = "boost"` fits a text predictor, where gbm refused it
  ("variable 1: grp is not of type numeric, ordered, or factor"), and
  `"xgboost"` predicts a single row of one, where it failed with
  "contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels". A
  text column used only inside a term, such as `as.numeric(code)`,
  keeps its type.

* `predict()` reads a supervised model's categorical columns against the
  levels it was trained on, before any method sees them. New data
  holding only some of the categories works with `"forest"`, which
  failed with "Type of predictors in new data do not match that of the
  training data" for `data.frame(cyl = factor("6"), wt = 3)`. A value
  given as text, or as the number a factor was made from, reads the
  same. A level the model was not trained on is an error naming the
  column, the level and the training levels; `"boost"` used to return a
  prediction for it, and the other methods' errors came from their
  backends.

* **`predict()` on a `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` or `"elastic_net"` model now
  uses `lambda_1se`, so its predictions change.** It used `lambda_min`,
  while `tl_coefficients()`, `tl_table_coefficients()` and importance
  all report `lambda_1se` by default, so the coefficients on display
  were not the ones behind the predictions. `lambda_1se` is the penalty
  the fit itself was documented as preferring for generalisation.
  Metrics, cross-validation and tuning scores for these methods move
  with it.

* A `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` or `"elastic_net"` model is now the full-data
  fit `cv.glmnet()` makes itself, in place of a second `glmnet()` run
  along the same penalties. The two agreed only to glmnet's convergence
  tolerance, so coefficients and predictions move slightly -- by up to
  0.004 at `lambda_1se` for `mpg ~ .` on `mtcars` with `set.seed(1)` --
  and now match `coef()` and `predict()` on the `cv.glmnet` object kept
  in `attr(model$fit, "cv_results")`. When cross-validation chooses the
  largest penalty, every slope is now exactly zero: the second fit left
  one at about -6e-17, which `tl_table_importance()` ranked at
  importance 100 and `tl_plot_importance_regularized()` drew as a bar of
  5.9e-17 (predictor `b` of 40 rows of noise drawn after
  `set.seed(3)`). Both now stop with the message that the penalty
  dropped every predictor, as for any penalty that keeps none.

* `method = "polynomial"` keeps a numeric term that is also part of an
  interaction as it is and adds its powers as `I(x^2)` up to the
  degree. For `mpg ~ wt * hp` the fit and its predictions are those of
  0.5.0, but the terms are now `wt`, `hp`, `I(wt^2)`, `I(hp^2)` and
  `wt:hp`, where 0.5.0 named them `poly(wt, degree = 2, raw = TRUE)1`,
  `poly(wt, degree = 2, raw = TRUE)2` and so on, so `tl_coefficients()`
  and `tl_table_coefficients()` list other names in another order.

* `predict()` on an unsupervised model returns `.obs_id`, the row names
  of the data predicted on, and as many components as the model keeps,
  on both the training and the new-data path. A two-dimensional MDS fit
  from `tl_reduce_dimensions(n_components = 2)` predicted `.obs_id` and
  `Dim1` only, and `Dim1` and `Dim2` without `.obs_id` for tibble
  input. PCA's training projection returned every component however
  many were kept. k-means assignments of new data had no `.obs_id`, and
  PCA projections of new data numbered the rows `"1"`, `"2"` whatever
  they were called.

* `predict(type = "prob")` on an `"xgboost"` model returns a tibble, as
  every other method does. It returned a data frame.

* `tl_split(stratify = )` cuts a numeric column with more than five
  distinct values at its quartiles. Each distinct value used to be a
  stratum, and a stratum holding a single row corrupted the split:
  `sample()` on one number draws from `1:n`, so that stratum drew a row
  from elsewhere in the data -- sometimes one already drawn -- and left
  its own row in test. On 50 rows of a continuous `y` with `seed = 1`,
  0.5.0 drew 50 training rows holding only 22 distinct observations and
  put 28 in test; the same call now splits 38/12, each quartile at
  `prop`. On `mtcars` stratified by `mpg`, most of whose values occur
  once, the split with `seed = 1` returned 43 rows from 32, and now
  splits 24/8. A numeric column with five or fewer distinct values, such
  as `cyl`, is still split by value. An integer ID such as `1:50` has
  more than five, so it is cut at its quartiles like any other numeric
  column. A stratum of a single row goes to the training set, so a level
  seen once is one the model was trained on. When such strata together
  hold more than a tenth of the rows, as in a character ID column, they
  are pooled into one stratum and split together; for a column of 50
  distinct strings that is the unstratified draw, 40/10. A split that
  leaves the test set empty, which only a single row now does, warns.

* `tl_model(method = "deep")` holds out a random set of rows for
  `validation_split`, recorded in `$fit$validation_rows`. keras holds
  out the last rows as given, which on `iris`, sorted by species, were
  rows 121 to 150: 30 of the 50 virginica rows, so the model trained on
  20 virginica against 50 of each other class and was validated on
  virginica alone. A row with a missing value is dropped from the
  predictors and the response together; the response kept it, so keras
  trained on pairs shifted by one row. A constant predictor is no longer
  scaled by its standard deviation of 0, which turned it into `NaN` and
  gave every row the same prediction.

* `tl_tune_xgboost()`, `tl_tune_nn()` and `tl_tune_deep()` read the task
  from the response, as `tl_model()` does. `is_classification` defaults
  to `NULL`, which treats a factor or character response, including one
  the formula computes such as `factor(am)`, as classification. With the
  old default of `FALSE`, `tl_tune_xgboost(iris, Species ~ .)` was tuned
  as a regression on the class codes without a message, and
  `tl_tune_nn()` and `tl_tune_deep()` failed.
  `is_classification = FALSE` with a factor response is an error, and so
  is `is_classification = TRUE` with a computed response that is not a
  factor, such as `I(mpg > 20)`, which `tl_tune_nn()` ran; the message
  points to `factor()` on the left-hand side. The response is reduced to
  the classes it holds, so a two-class subset of `iris` that still
  declares setosa is tuned as two classes; `tl_tune_xgboost()` had tuned
  it with `multi:softprob` and a setosa probability column.

* `tl_tune_deep()` returns the best configuration as a `tidylearn_model`
  in `$model`, so `predict()` and the deep plots take it; the keras
  model is at `$model$fit$model`. It returned the internal list, and
  `predict()` on it failed with `no applicable method`. Every
  configuration is scored on the same randomly held-out rows.

* `tl_default_param_grid("xgboost")` returns a grid: the values
  `tl_tune_xgboost()` searches by default, plus `nrounds`, which that
  function picks by early stopping and `tl_tune_grid()` has to tune. It
  warned "Unknown method" and returned an empty list.
  `is_classification`, which changed no grid, now changes two
  regression grids: `"svm"` also tunes `epsilon`, and the large
  `"forest"` grid uses `nodesize = c(3, 5, 10)` around randomForest's
  regression default of 5 in place of `c(1, 3, 5)`. With the default
  `is_classification = TRUE` the grids are unchanged.

* `tl_plot_xgboost_importance()` returns a ggplot, as documented, and
  ranks by the measure `importance_type` names. It returned
  `xgb.plot.importance()`'s data.table, drew with base graphics, and
  ignored `importance_type`. A linear booster (`booster = "gblinear"`)
  has only coefficients, which `importance_type = "weight"` draws,
  ranked by size; left at its default, `importance_type` takes them for
  such a model.

* `tl_plot_partial_dependence()` on a classification model draws one
  line per class when there are three or more, and the positive class
  (the second level) for two, named on the y axis. Its data has a
  `class` column for the class each row describes. The curve was the
  mean probability of the second class alone, and the multiclass
  `class` column held whichever class had the highest mean probability,
  which was not the class drawn.

* `...` in `tl_semisupervised()` and `tl_stratified_models()` reaches
  the supervised model only, and the new `cluster_args` takes the
  clustering step's settings. Both stages got `...`, so `cp = 0.001`
  failed in k-means with "unused argument", and `nstart = 5` reached
  k-means and then broke `glm()`. A clustering setting now goes in
  `cluster_args`, e.g. `cluster_args = list(nstart = 5)`; one left in
  `...`, such as `nstart`, `iter.max`, `algorithm`, `hclust_method` or
  pam's `variant`, is refused with a message saying so. `sampsize`,
  `keep.data` and `trace`, which randomForest, gbm and nnet take, still
  reach the supervised model.

* `tl_semisupervised()` with a response the formula computes, such as
  `factor(am) ~ wt + hp + qsec`, writes each propagated label to the
  column the response is computed from, as that column's own value in a
  labelled row of the same class. The returned `$data$am` therefore
  holds 0 and 1, where it held a factor.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` holds a variable it does not vary at its
  most frequent value, as `tl_plot_interaction()` does. It held a factor
  at its first level: with `carb` a factor, `mpg ~ wt * hp + carb` was
  evaluated at `carb = 1` by one function and `carb = 2` by the other.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` returns a factor variable in its results --
  `var`, `by_var` or a variable it holds fixed -- as a factor with the
  model's levels, where it was a character vector; the values are
  unchanged. That is what lets it work for a forest with a factor
  predictor, which failed with `Type of predictors in new data do not
  match that of the training data` because the grid held the factor as
  text. Both it and `tl_plot_interaction()` leave out a factor level no
  row uses: on iris without setosa, both predicted at setosa, which
  `predict()` refused as a new level. They also leave out a missing
  value of a character variable, which `tl_interaction_effects()` failed
  on with `0 (non-NA) cases`. A logical variable is treated as
  two-level; both functions failed with `variable 'lg' was fitted with
  type "logical" but type "numeric" was supplied`. A factor value given
  in `at_values` or `fixed_values` takes the column's levels, and one
  that is not a level is refused. `mpg ~ log(wt) * hp` no longer warns
  that the model has no `wt:hp` interaction.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` reports `fit`, `lower`, `upper` and `slope`
  on the response scale whether or not `intervals = TRUE`, and its `se`
  column is removed. With intervals a logistic model's values were log
  odds (`am ~ wt * hp` gave `fit` from -32 to 40) and without them
  probabilities. A glm's interval is now built on the link scale and
  transformed back, and a linear model's is the t-based interval
  `predict.lm()` gives. For a glm the `se` column was on the link scale.
  A model with no standard errors, such as a tree, failed with
  `$ operator is invalid for atomic vectors` and now returns point
  estimates with a message.

* `augment_hclust()` attaches clusters by position. It joined on
  `row_number()`, which counts within each group, so on a grouped
  tibble of `USArrests` cut at `k = 3` 34 of 50 rows received another
  row's cluster. Data with a different number of rows from the tree was
  padded with `NA` or cut short without a message; it is now an error
  naming both counts. The caller's grouping stays on the returned data,
  and so do its row names, which the join reset to `"1"`, `"2"`, ...; a
  `cluster` column the data already has is kept beside the new one
  under dplyr's repaired names (`cluster...5` and `cluster...6` for
  `USArrests`), where the join gave `cluster.x` and `cluster.y`.

* `tidy_rules()`, and so `tidy_apriori()`'s `rules_tbl`, gains the list
  columns `lhs_items` and `rhs_items`, each side's items as a character
  vector, after the quality measures. The item-matching helpers read
  them; a table of rules without them is refused with a message saying
  to keep them, and a `tidy_apriori()` result saved without them is
  rebuilt from the rules it carries. An empty rule set now gives a
  zero-row tibble with the usual columns. It gave a tibble with no
  columns, so `recommend_products()` failed with `object 'confidence'
  not found`, `filter_rules_by_item()` and `find_related_items()` with
  `object 'lhs' not found`, and `visualize_rules()` when the plot was
  drawn; they now return zero rows, or an empty plot.

* `tidy_pam()`'s `medoid_index` is the medoid's integer row position.
  `pam()` reports medoids by label when the distances carry labels, so
  `tidy_pam(mtcars, k = 3)` gave `"Toyota Corona"`, `"Merc 450SE"` and
  `"Duster 360"` where the same data as a tibble gave 21, 12 and 7. Both
  now give 21, 12 and 7.

* `calc_validation_metrics()` and `compare_clusterings()` gain an
  `n_noise` column, after `avg_size`, counting the points labelled 0,
  DBSCAN's label for noise. The other clustering methods number their
  clusters from 1, so it is 0 for them. The columns after it move one
  place along.

* Counts that ran a range backwards or reached `cutree()` as a vector
  are refused with a message naming the argument. `get_pca_loadings()`
  and `augment_pca()` with `n_components = 0` returned PC1, since `1:0`
  is `c(1, 0)`, and `get_pca_loadings(n_components = 5)` on a
  four-component PCA returned all four; `n_components` must now be
  between 1 and the number of components. `tidy_cutree(k = 2:3)`
  returned 100 rows for 50 observations, and now requires a single `k`
  or `h`. `compare_clusterings()` returned a 0 x 0 tibble for an unnamed
  list, or for a single vector passed in place of a list, and failed on
  an unnamed entry of a named one; it names such entries
  `clustering_1`, `clustering_2`, ..., and refuses anything that is not
  a list. `max_k = 1` in `optimal_hclust_k()`,
  `tidy_silhouette_analysis()` and `tidy_gap_stat()`, and `max_k = 0`
  in `calc_wss()`, are refused by name, where the first two failed with
  `incorrect number of dimensions`, `tidy_gap_stat()` with
  `K.max >= 2 is not TRUE`, and `calc_wss()` inside `kmeans()`.

* The `source_file` column names each row's file by its path below the
  directory or archive it came from, or, for paths given to `tl_read()`
  directly, below the deepest folder they share. It held base names, so
  `tl_read_dir(recursive = TRUE)` labelled `2023/sales.csv` and
  `2024/sales.csv` both `sales.csv`, losing a partition key held in a
  folder name. Files in one folder keep their bare names. When one file
  already has a `source_file` column, every file's label now goes to
  `tl_source_file`; the choice was made per file, which put the other
  files' labels in that file's own column. The `tl_source` attribute of
  a zip member read on its own names the member's path within the
  archive too, as `archive.zip//2024/sales.csv` where it held
  `archive.zip//sales.csv`.

* `tl_read_dir()`, `tl_read()` on a folder, and `tl_read_zip()` without
  `file` read compressed CSV and TSV files and `.ndjson` files along
  with the rest, so a folder or archive holding them next to other data
  now row-binds them too: a folder of `cars.csv` and
  `cars_backup.csv.gz` returned mtcars's 32 rows and now returns 64.
  `format = "csv"` takes the compressed CSVs as well. `pattern` restores
  0.5.0's selection for a folder:
  `pattern = "\\.(csv|tsv|xlsx?|xlsm|parquet|json|rds|rdata|rda)$"`
  in place of the default scan, or `pattern = "\\.csv$"` in place of
  `format = "csv"`, matching the case of the extension where 0.5.0
  ignored it. In an archive, name the member with `file`. Scans still
  skip `.txt` files, which `tl_read()` reads as CSV only when named
  directly.

* `tl_read_kaggle()` finds a requested file the Kaggle CLI saved under
  its base name, so `file = "data/train.csv"` is read where it was
  reported missing. Without `file`, the search for a data file uses the
  extensions its readers handle, from the same table as
  `tl_read_dir()`: it knew six of its own, so a dataset of `.ndjson`,
  `.xlsm` or compressed CSV files had "no data files", and where such
  files sit beside others the newest of all of them is now read.

* `tl_read_zip(format = )` selects the members of that format from an
  archive holding a single data file, as it already did for several. It
  forced the format onto a lone member, so a zip holding only
  `data.json` read with `format = "csv"` returned 0 rows with fragments
  of the JSON as column names; it is now an error saying the archive
  holds no CSV. To force a format onto a member, name it with `file`.

* On R before 4.4.0, `tl_read_github()` and `tl_read_s3()` refuse
  `.rds`, `.rdata` and `.rda` files unless the new `trust_rds = TRUE` is
  given. Those versions can run code embedded in a crafted file as it is
  read (CVE-2024-27322), and these readers handed downloaded bytes
  straight to `readRDS()` and `load()`. R 4.4.0 and later read them as
  before. The help pages of `tl_read_rds()` and `tl_read_rdata()` say to
  read such files only from trusted sources.

* `tl_check_gpu()` no longer reports `torch`, which is neither a
  tidylearn backend nor a suggested package, so its `backends` list has
  three entries. It reads which backends are installed from the
  library: `requireNamespace()` loaded xgboost, tensorflow, keras and
  reticulate to learn they were there, and loading keras set
  `TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS = "1"` for the rest of the session. `nvidia-smi`
  is given 10 seconds to answer, after which the check warns and
  reports no GPU; a hung driver held up `tl_check_gpu()`,
  `tl_compute_advisor()` and every xgboost or deep fit with
  `compute = "auto"` or `"gpu"` for as long as it hung.

* `tl_cloud_allow_host()` refuses a host name of fewer than three
  labels. `co.uk`, `github.io` and `ngrok.io` were accepted, after which
  any site registered under them, such as `attacker.co.uk`, passed as an
  upload destination. Without the Public Suffix List the rule is the
  label count, so it also refuses an apex domain such as `example.com`,
  and a public suffix of three or more labels still passes. Give the
  endpoint's full host name. Cloud submission is not wired up, so no
  upload could reach such a host.

## New Features

* `tl_coefficients()` returns a model's coefficients as a tibble, with
  standard errors, test statistics, p-values and -- with
  `conf_int = TRUE` -- a confidence interval. It covers `"linear"`,
  `"polynomial"`, `"logistic"`, `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and
  `"elastic_net"`. Until now the only coefficient output was
  `tl_table_coefficients()`, which needs the suggested `gt` package
  installed, returns a formatted table rather than data, and carried no
  interval — so getting a slope and its interval meant reaching into
  `model$fit` and calling `confint()` by hand.

  `exponentiate = TRUE` reports odds ratios for a classification model.
  The standard error stays on the log-odds scale it was computed on and
  is renamed `std_error_log`, because `exp()` of a standard error is not
  the standard error of `exp(estimate)`.

  Intervals are Wald intervals, built from the standard errors reported
  alongside them, so the interval and the p-value in a row always agree
  about whether zero is excluded. For `"linear"` and `"polynomial"` they
  match `confint()` on the underlying `lm` exactly. For `"logistic"`
  they use the *z* the summary reports rather than profiling the
  likelihood, which `confint(model$fit)` still gives you.

  Regularised methods return the estimates and the `lambda` they came
  from. `conf_int = TRUE` is an error there rather than a column of
  `NA`: glmnet reports no standard errors, and a Wald interval on a
  shrunken estimate would not cover at its stated rate. A multiclass
  regularised model has a set of coefficients per class, returned under
  a `class` column and grouped by class in the table. `exponentiate` is
  refused there: glmnet's multinomial coefficients are not relative to a
  reference class, so their exponent is not an odds ratio.

* `tl_table_coefficients()` gained `conf_int`, `level` and
  `exponentiate`, passed through to `tl_coefficients()`. A call without
  them gives the table it gave before, apart from three changes
  described elsewhere in this section: regularised coefficients come
  from the `cv.glmnet()` fit, a term the fit could not estimate gets a
  row, and the source note counts the rows the fit used. With
  `exponentiate = TRUE` a regularised table ranks terms by the size of
  the log odds ratio: ranked by the odds ratio itself, a term the
  penalty dropped (1) sorted above a strong negative effect (0.02).

* `tl_tune_grid()`, `tl_tune_random()` and `tl_compare_cv()` accept
  `folds = nrow(data)` and leave each row out in turn, as `tl_cv()`
  does, and so does `tl_run_pipeline()` with `evaluation$cv_folds`
  equal to the number of rows. rsample's `vfold_cv()` refused it with
  "Leave-one-out cross-validation is not supported by this function".

* `tl_read()` and `tl_read_json()` read newline-delimited `.ndjson`
  files, through `jsonlite::stream_in()`, and `tl_read_json()` reads a
  `.json` file holding one record per line (JSON Lines). Both failed
  with "parse error: trailing garbage": the `.ndjson` extension was
  mapped to JSON, and a JSON Lines file was read as a single document. A
  file that parses neither way is an error naming both. CSV and TSV
  files compressed with gzip, bzip2 or xz (`data.csv.gz`) are recognised
  by the extension under the compression one.

* `tl_model(method = "mds")` reaches every MDS variant. `tl_model()`'s
  own `method` argument holds `"mds"`, so `tidy_mds()`'s `"metric"`,
  `"nonmetric"`, `"sammon"` and `"kruskal"` could not be asked for, and
  `ndim = 3` failed with `formal argument "ndim" matched by multiple
  actual arguments`. The variant is now chosen with `mds_method`
  (default `"classical"`), and the dimension count is `ndim` or `k`;
  giving both with different values is an error.

* `tl_model(method = "hclust")` takes the linkage as `hclust_method`
  (default `"average"`), as `tl_model(method = "mds")` takes
  `mds_method`. `tl_model()`'s own `method` argument holds `"hclust"`,
  so the linkage could not be chosen and every tree used average
  linkage.

* `tidy_mds()` takes `distance = "gower"`, computed by `tidy_gower()`
  over every column, and `tl_model(method = "mds", distance = "gower")`
  uses the factor columns its formula names. `distance` went straight to
  `stats::dist()`, which failed with `invalid distance method`.
  Classical MDS on undefined distances, a pair of rows with no variable
  observed in both, now stops naming the rows and pointing to
  `method = "metric"` or `"nonmetric"`, which leave them out;
  `cmdscale()` said only `NA values not allowed in 'd'`.

* `tidy_apriori()` no longer prints arules' 21-line mining trace on
  every call. It gains `control`, whose `verbose` defaults to `FALSE`;
  the rest of the list goes to `arules::apriori()` as given, and
  `control = list(verbose = TRUE)` brings the trace back. Its new `...`
  reaches `arules::apriori()` too: `appearance`, and further mining
  parameters such as `smax` or `maxtime`. `tidy_clara()` and
  `tidy_pam()` gain `...` for the arguments of `cluster::clara()` and
  `cluster::pam()`: `tidy_clara(x, k = 3, correct.d = TRUE)` was
  `unused argument`, and `tidy_pam()` can now take `nstart`, `variant`
  or starting `medoids`. `cluster.only = TRUE` for both, `diss` for
  `tidy_pam()` and `medoids.x = FALSE` for `tidy_clara()` are refused,
  under any abbreviation R accepts, since the result is built from the
  full fit and its medoids.

## Bug Fixes

### Fitting and prediction

* `tl_model()` decides between classification and regression from the
  response the formula computes. `factor(cyl) ~ wt` with
  `method = "linear"` was fitted by `lm()` on the factor codes, with
  only backend warnings, and is now refused as a factor with 3 classes;
  with `"ridge"` it was treated as regression and failed with "invalid
  to change the storage mode of a factor", and with `"forest"` it
  returned a classification forest described as a regression. A
  response the formula computes as text, such as
  `ifelse(mpg > 20, "hi", "lo") ~ wt + hp`, is classified as the factor
  it encodes by `"nn"`, `"forest"` and `"svm"`, and by `tl_tune_nn()`:
  nnet stopped with `NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 2)`,
  randomForest with `non-numeric argument to binary operator`, and e1071
  with `Need numeric dependent variable for regression.` A
  supervised method given a one-sided formula, or none, says it needs a
  two-sided formula naming the response. Given `~ wt + hp`, `"forest"`
  fitted an unsupervised forest, `"xgboost"` a booster with no
  objective, and `"polynomial"` a model of `wt` on itself and `hp`;
  `"logistic"` took `wt` as the response and refused it, and the other
  methods failed inside their backends, `"linear"` with "incompatible
  dimensions".

* `predict()` passes a method only the columns its formula uses. A
  column the model never saw counted as a predictor wherever a method
  expanded a `.` formula over the new data: an extra, mostly-missing
  `notes` column turned 27 of 30 `"svm"` predictions `NA`, and an extra
  column gave `"xgboost"` a warning about columns not in the training
  data.

* `predict()` on a supervised model refuses new data that lacks a column
  the model's predictors were fitted on: "New data is missing predictors
  used at fit time: hp". `model.frame()` looks a variable up in the data
  and then in the formula's environment, so every method took a missing
  column from a same-named object in the caller's session, or failed
  with "object 'hp' not found" when there was none:
  `predict(tl_model(mtcars, mpg ~ wt + hp, method = "linear"), nd)` on
  data without `hp` returned predictions built from a global `hp`. A
  variable the formula takes from its environment, such as `k` in
  `offset(k * disp)`, is not required. `tl_xgboost_shap()`,
  `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_summary()` and
  `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_dependence()` check `data` the same way, where
  they computed SHAP values from a global `hp` or failed with
  `object 'hp' not found`.

* `predict(type = "prob")` and `type = "class"` on a regression model
  are errors. Both returned the numeric predictions, and a regression
  model ignored a misspelt type in the same way; an unrecognised type is
  now an error for every supervised model. `predict()` on zero rows
  returns zero rows with the columns and types of a non-empty
  prediction, where `"logistic"` failed with "eta must be a nonempty
  numeric vector", the class probabilities of a multiclass `"ridge"`,
  `"lasso"` or `"elastic_net"` model with "non-conformable arrays", and
  `"xgboost"` with an input pointer misalignment.

* A supervised model fitted on a formula that subtracts a column, such
  as `y ~ . - id`, no longer needs that column at `predict()`.
  `terms()` keeps a subtracted column among its variables, so every
  method but `"polynomial"` and `"boost"` refused new data without it,
  most with "object 'id' not found" -- the baselines `tl_auto_ml()` fits
  on such a formula among them. The model is now fitted on the formula
  written out without the column; `$spec$formula`, `print()` and every
  refit keep the formula as written, and a missing value in the
  subtracted column no longer leaves an `"svm"` prediction `NA`. A
  subtracted name that is neither a column of the data nor, for a
  supervised model, a variable in the formula's environment -- usually
  a misspelling, as in `mpg ~ . - qsce` -- is an error that names it.

* **`tl_model(subset = )` fits the selected rows, with every method, and
  stores only those in `$data`.** `"linear"`, `"logistic"` and `"nn"`
  failed on `subset` with "..1 used in an incorrect context", `"boost"`
  with "unused argument", and `"tree"`, `"ridge"`, `"lasso"`,
  `"elastic_net"` and `"xgboost"` fitted every row, `"xgboost"` warning
  "Passed unrecognized parameters: subset"; a regularised fit with
  `subset = 1:16` used all 32 rows. `"forest"`, `"svm"` and
  `"polynomial"` fitted the selected rows but kept every row in
  `$data`, so `predict(model)` and `tl_evaluate(model)`
  scored rows the fit never saw. The other per-row arguments, such as
  `weights`, are taken to the same rows.

* **`tl_model()` passes case `weights` to `lm()`, `glm()` and `rpart()`,
  to gbm for `"boost"`, to nnet for `"nn"` and to the training
  `xgb.DMatrix()` for `"xgboost"`, so weighted `"tree"` and `"xgboost"`
  fits change.** For `"linear"`, `"logistic"`, `"boost"` and `"nn"` it
  failed with `..1 used in an incorrect context`, and `"xgboost"` warned
  that it did not recognise them and fitted without them. `"svm"` and
  `"deep"` refuse `weights`: e1071 has no case weights, so a weighted
  svm fit was identical to the unweighted one while the model recorded
  that weights had been used, and keras's `fit()` accepted them through
  its `...` and ignored them. `class.weights` still reaches e1071.

  For `"tree"`, every extra argument went to `rpart.control()`, which
  discards what it does not recognise, so `weights`, `parms`, `cost` and
  a whole `control` list were accepted and had no effect, `maxdeth = 1`
  fitted the default tree, and `offset = mtcars$hp` fitted without an
  offset. `rpart()`'s own arguments now go to `rpart()`, and an argument
  that neither `rpart()` nor `rpart.control()` takes is refused by name,
  as `rpart()` itself refuses one. An explicit `minsplit` given with a
  `control` list brings its derived `minbucket`, unless `minbucket` is
  passed too.

* `tl_model()` refuses an offset for `"ridge"`, `"lasso"`,
  `"elastic_net"`, `"tree"`, `"forest"`, `"boost"`, `"svm"`, `"nn"`,
  `"deep"` and `"xgboost"`, whether as an `offset()` term in the formula
  or as the `offset` argument, and names it. For the regularised
  methods an `offset()` term was left out of the fit -- the coefficients
  of `mpg ~ wt + hp + offset(disp / 100)` were those of the fit with no
  offset -- and an `offset` argument was fitted but left `predict()`
  failing with `No newoffset provided for prediction`; their error
  points to `"linear"` or `"logistic"` with `offset()` in the formula.
  None of the other seven applies an offset at `predict()`: rpart and
  gbm fit an `offset()` term as a shift of the response that their
  predictions never add back, and the other five leave it out of the
  fit. Held at the same predictors, each method's prediction moved by 0
  when the offset moved by 100. As an argument, an offset was ignored
  without a message by `"tree"`, `"forest"`, `"svm"`, `"nn"` and
  `"deep"`; `"xgboost"` warned that xgboost did not recognise it, and
  `"boost"` stopped with gbm's `unused argument`. `"linear"` and
  `"logistic"` still take an `offset()` term, and `"polynomial"`, which
  dropped one, now applies it. An `offset` argument is refused with a
  pointer to `offset()` in the formula, which is the form `predict()`
  can apply to new data.

* A classification model's classes (`$spec$response_levels`) are those
  of the rows it is fitted on. Every method but `"tree"`, `"boost"` and
  `"xgboost"` leaves out rows with a missing value, so a class whose
  every row has one is not in the fit; in `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and
  `"elastic_net"` it stayed a level of the fitted response. With each
  setosa `Sepal.Width` in `iris` missing, `"lasso"` failed at fit with
  "one multinomial or binomial class has 1 or 0 observations; not
  allowed", and `"nn"` failed at `predict()` with "'names' attribute [3]
  must be the same length as the vector [2]"; both now fit and predict
  the two remaining classes, and the regularised methods fit
  `Species ~ .` as versicolor against virginica. A `"logistic"` fit left
  with a single class fitted without a message, and is now refused; a
  regularised fit left with one class stops with a message saying so.

* `update()` and `step()` on a model's `$fit` refit on the training
  rows. The stored call named `data`, which both functions evaluate in
  the caller's environment: a script that called its full data `data`
  refitted an 18-row model on all 32 rows, and with nothing in scope
  called `data` the refit failed with "'data' must be a data.frame,
  environment, or list". The call now refers to the data it was fitted
  with and prints as `data = <environment>$data`; a weighted fit, which
  0.5.0 could not make, refits with its weights. The call names its
  function with its package, as in `rpart::rpart`, so `update()` works
  in a session that has not attached rpart, randomForest, e1071, nnet or
  gbm. A saved model holds the training data a second time: a tree
  fitted on 20,000 rows saves at 1.1 MB, against 0.6 MB in 0.5.0.

* **`predict()` on an `"xgboost"`, `"deep"` or `"boost"` model computes
  a data-dependent term of the formula, such as `scale(hp)` or
  `poly(wt, 2)`, with the values the training data gave it, as
  `predict.lm()` does.** The term was recomputed on the rows being
  predicted, so a row's prediction depended on the rows scored with it:
  for `mpg ~ scale(hp) + wt` with `nrounds = 20`, the fifth row of
  `mtcars` predicted 15.0 alone and 18.6 inside the full frame. With
  `"boost"` on `mtcars` stacked twice, `n.trees = 50` and `set.seed(1)`,
  row 5 predicted 14.72 alone and 17.28 inside the frame. A
  matrix-valued term such as `poly(wt, 2)` failed to fit with boost
  (`number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement
  length`); it now enters as one predictor per column, as with
  `"forest"`. A transform that needs nothing from training, such as
  `log(hp)`, is fitted through gbm's formula interface as before.

* **`tl_model(method = "boost")` reads a formula variable that is not a
  column of the data from the formula's environment, as `lm()` does, at
  fit and at `predict()`.** gbm rebuilt its predictors in its own
  environment, which reaches only the global one, so `mpg ~ wt + z` with
  `z` defined inside a function failed with `object 'z' not found`, and
  where a global `z` existed as well, gbm fitted and predicted on the
  global one while the response came from the data.

* **`"xgboost"`, `"deep"`, `tl_tune_xgboost()` and `tl_tune_nn()` fit
  and score the response the formula computes.** The first three fitted
  `log(mpg) ~ wt + hp` to `mpg` itself, so `"xgboost"` predicted 21.0
  for the Mazda RX4, whose log mpg is 3.04, and `tl_tune_nn()` scored
  its folds against the raw column.

* `method = "logistic"` fits a response the formula computes. It was
  read off the first column named, so `I(mpg > 20) ~ wt` and
  `ifelse(mpg > 20, "hi", "lo") ~ wt` were refused with `Logistic
  regression needs a two-class response, but 'mpg' is numeric with 25
  distinct values`, and `I(am + 1) ~ wt` failed with `Argument mu must
  be a nonempty numeric vector`. Its predictions, probabilities and
  coefficients are now those of `glm()` on the same formula, a response
  computed as text or as numbers other than 0 and 1 being fitted as the
  factor it encodes, and the ROC, precision-recall, calibration and
  confusion plots score the computed response too. A computed factor
  whose first level no row has is refused, with a pointer to
  `droplevels()`: `glm()` would have compared every row with that empty
  class.

* **`method = "polynomial"` adds its terms to the formula as written.**
  The formula was rebuilt from the response's name and the term labels,
  so `log(mpg) ~ wt` was fitted as a model of `mpg`: row 1 of `mtcars`
  predicted 22.91 where `log(mpg)` is 3.04, and now predicts 3.11.
  `offset()` terms and `- 1` were dropped, `poly(wt, 3)` became
  `poly(poly(wt, 3), ...)`, and a factor went into `poly()` on its
  integer codes, so on `iris` `Sepal.Length ~ .` predicted 6.96 for
  row 101, or 7.66 once `droplevels()` had renumbered the levels. Each
  numeric main effect is now replaced by its polynomial, and predictions
  match `lm()` on the same formula written out by hand. A numeric term
  that is also part of an interaction keeps its own term and gains
  `I(x^2)` up to the degree, so the interaction is coded as written:
  `mpg ~ cyl_f * wt`, with `cyl_f` a factor, returned an `NA`
  coefficient for `cyl_f8:wt`, and now fits
  `mpg ~ cyl_f * wt + I(wt^2)`. Factors, `I()` terms and bases such as
  `poly()` or a spline's are left as written.

* **`predict()` on a `method = "polynomial"` model computes a
  data-dependent term such as `scale(wt)` with the training data's
  centre and scale, so its predictions on new rows change.** Inside the
  `poly()` or `I()` the expansion wraps it in, the term was recomputed
  on the rows being predicted, so for `mpg ~ scale(wt) + hp` on
  `mtcars` a single row predicted `NaN`, and `mtcars[1:5, ]` predicted
  20.48 for its second row against a fitted value of 21.71.
  Cross-validation scored each held-out fold on its own centre and
  scale: `tl_cv()` on `mpg ~ scale(wt) + hp` at `folds = 4` after
  `set.seed(1)` reported a mean rmse of 2.43, and now reports 2.34.

* **`"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` keep every predictor of a
  formula without an intercept.** The design matrix's first column was
  dropped as the intercept, so `mpg ~ wt + hp + disp - 1` (or `+ 0`) was
  fitted on `hp` and `disp` alone, with no message. glmnet still fits
  its own intercept; pass `intercept = FALSE` to fit without one.

* `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` cross-validate a sequence of
  penalties. `lambda = c(1, 0.1)` fitted the path with no penalty
  chosen, and `predict()` returned 64 rows for 32. The sequence now goes
  to `cv.glmnet()`, which chooses `lambda_min` and `lambda_1se` from it
  (set a seed for a reproducible choice), so the model predicts,
  `tl_plot_regularization_cv()` works for it, and
  `tl_plot_regularization_path()` marks one `lambda.min` and one
  `lambda.1se` in place of a dashed line at every penalty. A single
  `lambda` is fitted as given, as before.

* `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` reject an argument that
  neither `glmnet()` nor `cv.glmnet()` takes. Both discard names they do
  not know, so a misspelt `standardise = FALSE` changed nothing, and
  `strata` was ignored the same way. A cross-validation argument such as
  `type.measure` or `foldid` given with a single `lambda`, where no
  cross-validation runs, is refused as well. `nfolds`, `family`, `x` and
  `y` are refused with a message saying what sets each: `cv_folds` sets
  the number of folds, and the response sets the family. Passed beside
  tidylearn's own value, they failed with R's `formal argument "nfolds"
  matched by multiple actual arguments`. `relax = TRUE` and `gamma` are
  refused too, because predictions and coefficients come from the
  unrelaxed fit; `relax = TRUE` failed with `no applicable method for
  'family' applied to an object of class "NULL"`.

* `weights` and `foldid` work with `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and
  `"elastic_net"` on data with missing values. Incomplete rows were
  dropped from the predictors but not from these per-row values, so one
  missing value failed with `number of elements in weights (32) not
  equal to the number of rows of x (31)`, or `logical subscript too
  long` for `foldid`. They now follow the rows the fit keeps, as in
  `lm()`.

* `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` given a single predictor
  column, such as `mpg ~ wt`, stop with a message saying they need two,
  in place of glmnet's `x should be a matrix with 2 or more columns`,
  which names an argument the caller never passed.

* **`predict()` on an `"svm"` model returns one row per row of
  `new_data`, with `NA` only where a predictor is missing.** e1071's
  `predict.svm()` dropped every row with a missing value in any column
  of `new_data`, the response and unused columns included, so
  `Ozone ~ Temp + Wind` on `airquality` returned 111 predictions for 153
  rows, and the rows that came back no longer lined up with the input. A
  classification model scored on `iris` with two missing values in an
  unused column returned 148 predictions for 150 rows. When no row has
  every predictor, every row is `NA`; `predict.svm()` failed with
  `test data does not match model !`.

* `tl_model(method = "forest")` fits formulas with a transformed term,
  such as `mpg ~ log(hp) + wt` or `mpg ~ factor(cyl) + wt`.
  randomForest's formula interface fails on them with `object 'hp' not
  found`, so for those formulas tidylearn builds the predictor frame
  itself and rebuilds it from the raw columns at `predict()`, each term
  computed as in training: `scale(hp)` with the training centre and
  scale, and `poly()`, `ns()` or `bs()` with the training coefficients,
  each of their columns a predictor of its own. A row therefore predicts
  the same alone as among other rows. Formulas of plain columns still go
  through randomForest's formula interface.

* Values the method wrappers set themselves give way to the caller's,
  where naming one failed with `formal argument matched by multiple
  actual arguments`: `probability` and `type` for `"svm"`, `linout` for
  `"nn"`, `verbose` and, for regression, `distribution` for `"boost"`,
  `maxit` and `trace` in `tl_tune_nn()`, and `verbose` in
  `tl_tune_deep()`. For classification, `"boost"` refuses a
  `distribution` other than the one it sets from the response, since
  its predictions read only bernoulli and multinomial fits.

* `tl_model(method = "xgboost")` keeps a row with a missing predictor,
  which xgboost routes itself, and drops a row with a missing response.
  A missing predictor failed with `The length of labels must equal to
  the number of rows in the input data`.

* `tl_model(method = "xgboost")` puts booster settings passed through
  `...`, such as `max_leaves`, `tree_method` or `booster`, into
  `params`. xgboost 3.x moved them there itself but warned that doing so
  will become an error. A setting tidylearn also sets, such as
  `objective` or `eval_metric`, takes the caller's value; xgboost 3.x
  had refused an `objective` passed this way. `early_stopping_rounds` is
  refused by name unless a validation set is passed as `evals`
  (`watchlist` before xgboost 3.0). It failed with xgboost's `For early
  stopping, 'evals' must have at least one element`. A validation set
  passed under the other version's name is renamed, in
  `tl_tune_xgboost()` too, where it reaches the final fit; xgboost 3.x
  renamed `watchlist` itself with a warning that doing so will become an
  error.

* `tl_model(method = "xgboost", booster = "gblinear")` leaves out the
  tree parameters tidylearn sets by default (`max_depth`, `subsample`,
  `colsample_bytree`, `min_child_weight`, `gamma`), unless they are
  named. Every such fit printed xgboost's `Parameters: { ... } are not
  used`.

* **`predict(iterationrange = )` on an `"xgboost"` model uses the rounds
  it documents, `c(start, end)` inclusive of both ends, on every xgboost
  version.** Before xgboost 3.0, which reads the end as exclusive,
  `c(1, 5)` predicted from four rounds; `ntreelimit` was translated the
  same way. A range past the model's last round, or with its start after
  its end, is refused by name, where xgboost 3.x stopped with `Check
  failed: end <= model.BoostedRounds()`.

* `predict()` on a multiclass `"nn"` model returns `NA` for a row with a
  missing predictor. The default type and `type = "class"` failed with
  `invalid subscript type 'list'`.

* `predict()` on a `"deep"` model scores data without the response
  column, which failed with `object 'Species' not found`; returns `NA`
  for a row with a missing predictor, where three rows in came back as
  two; and reads factors on their training levels, so new data holding
  fewer levels is scored. keras no longer prints a progress bar on every
  prediction.

### Metrics and evaluation

* **`tl_evaluate()` scores a model against the response its formula
  fits, the left-hand side evaluated on the scored rows.** It read the
  raw column, so a model of `log(mpg) ~ wt + hp` compared log-scale
  predictions with miles per gallon: rmse 18.1 on the training data for
  a fit whose residual rmse is 0.106, and with `set.seed(1)`
  `tl_cv(folds = 3)` reported rmse 18.0 and rsq -11.7 (now 0.133 and
  0.731). `tl_cv()`, `tl_compare_cv()` and the tuners score through
  `tl_evaluate()`, so they move with it: with `set.seed(1)` and 3 folds,
  `tl_tune_grid()` on a tree of `log(mpg) ~ .` gave every `cp` the same
  18.13 and now gives the log-scale 0.220.

* **`tl_evaluate()` reads the observed classes against the classes the
  model was trained on, and takes the model's second class as the
  positive one.** A test split of `iris[iris$Species != "setosa", ]`
  still declares setosa, so every method stopped with "truth and
  estimate levels must be equivalent", and `tl_cv()`, `tl_compare_cv()`,
  the tuners, pipelines and `tl_auto_ml()` stopped the same way whenever
  a fold lacked a class: a logistic model of mtcars' 0/1 `am` crashed
  `tl_cv(folds = 10)` for seeds 1 to 4. Rows of a class the model never
  saw, which a fold whose training rows missed a class produces, are
  left out with a warning naming the class.
  `tl_calc_classification_metrics()`, which has no model to consult,
  takes its classes from the levels of `predicted`, as `predict()`
  returns them, plus any other class it finds; a prediction factor built
  by hand without a class the truth holds stopped with the same
  yardstick error, and those rows now count as errors. Predictions
  passed as character were read against every level the truth declared,
  so the values change: for a tree fitted on `iris[51:150, ]`, whose
  `Species` still declares setosa, precision and recall were a
  three-class macro average of 0.943 and 0.940 and are now the binary
  0.978 and 0.900.

* **`pr_auc` agrees with `yardstick::pr_auc()`.** The area was
  integrated from the curve's first finite point rather than from
  recall 0, so everything before that point was lost: a tree on two iris
  species reported 0.074 where yardstick gives 0.964, and a perfect
  ranking of 5 positives in 20 scored 0.8. With constant probabilities
  the `pr_auc` row was missing from the result. For more than two
  classes `pr_auc` was never computed and is now the average of the
  one-vs-rest areas, as `"auc"` is. The area in
  `tl_plot_precision_recall()`'s subtitle comes from the same corrected
  calculation.

* `tl_evaluate()` refuses to score when no row is left, where it
  returned `NaN` for `accuracy`, `rmse` and `mae` without a message.
  That covers `new_data` with no rows, such as an empty test split, and
  rows that are all dropped: for a missing response, a missing
  prediction (as wherever a predictor is missing) or a class the model
  was not trained on, and the message counts each. The error has class
  `tidylearn_no_scored_rows`. `tl_cv()` catches it and leaves that fold
  out of the summary, with a warning giving the reason.
  `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` refuses an empty or wholly
  incomplete input the same way.

* `tl_evaluate()` and `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` refuse a metric
  name they do not compute, listing the ones they do.
  `tl_evaluate(model, metrics = "RMSE")`, a classification metric on a
  regression model and `tl_cv(metrics = "RMSE")` each returned a 0-row
  tibble without a message. `metrics = "sensitivity"` no longer adds a
  `recall` row it was not asked for.

* `tl_evaluate()` and `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` drop a row
  missing its observed class, prediction or probability before computing
  any metric, as the regression metrics already did. An `NA` in a
  predictor stopped `"auc"` with "'predictions' contains NA.", and an
  `NA` response with "Not enough distinct predictions", while
  `"accuracy"` dropped the same rows.

* `"auc"` and `"pr_auc"` are `NA`, with a warning, when the scored rows
  hold a single class. ROCR stopped on them with "Number of classes is
  not equal to 2", which aborted `tl_compare_cv()` (with its default
  metrics, `set.seed(2)` and 5 folds on mtcars' `am`) and, with
  `set.seed(1)`, `tl_tune_grid(metric = "auc", folds = 10)`. The fold
  now counts as unscored and the summaries average the others. For more
  than two classes, a class with no scored row gets an `NA`
  `auc_<class>` row and is left out of the averages, with a warning.

* `tl_cv()` checks its arguments. `folds` must be a whole number between
  2 and `nrow(data)`; `folds = 2.5` ran two folds without a message.
  `weights`, `subset`, `offset`, `foldid` and `strata` passed through
  `...` are refused by name, as `tl_compare_cv()` refuses them, since
  they hold one value per row and each fold fits a subset of the rows. A
  tree ignored them: on `mpg ~ wt + hp` with `set.seed(1)`, 3 folds and
  `weights = seq_len(32) / 32`, rmse was 4.84, the same as without
  weights. A linear model failed with "..1 used in an incorrect
  context". An argument set to `NULL` is not refused. A one-column data
  frame, as `y ~ 1` uses, is kept a data frame in each fold, where it
  failed with "'data' must be a data frame".

* `tl_cv()` gives the warning that `method = "logistic"` converts a
  numeric 0/1 response to a factor once per run. It came once per fold,
  so a logistic model of mtcars' `am` at `folds = 5` warned five times.

* `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` refuses `predicted_probs` without a
  column for every class. A frame missing one was scored as a different
  problem: two classes with only the `a` column gave `auc` and `auc_a`
  of 1. A vector is refused with the shape it needs, where it failed
  with "argument is of length zero". A matrix with a column per class
  is accepted, read by column name, where it failed with "subscript out
  of bounds". The function warns when `thresholds` are ignored, for more
  than two classes or without probabilities, and when `"auc"` or
  `"pr_auc"` is asked for by name without probabilities. The input and
  output shapes of it and `tl_evaluate()` are documented, including the
  `threshold` column `thresholds` adds and the placeholder row an
  unsupervised model returns.

### Tuning and model selection

* A parameter set that fails on some folds can no longer be chosen as
  best. Its `mean_metric` was averaged over whichever folds survived, so
  it could win on the easier folds alone, and nothing in the results
  said so. The results now carry an `n_folds_ok` column, and only sets
  scored on every fold are eligible. If no set completes every fold, the
  best of the most complete sets is used, with a warning naming it. When
  every set fails in every fold the tuners stop with a message saying
  so, where they failed with `argument is of length zero`.

  The count and the warning cover folds whose fit succeeded but could
  not be scored, as well as failed fits, and the warning says which
  happened. A fold goes unscored when the metric is undefined there --
  precision where nothing is predicted positive, auc on a fold holding
  one class -- or when none of its rows can be scored, such as one where
  every predictor is missing, which is warned about by fold and
  parameter set. In 0.5.0 such folds were dropped from the mean without
  a mention: with `metric = "precision"` on `mtcars`'s `am`,
  `folds = 10` and `set.seed(1)`, both sets were scored on 7 of the 10
  folds. A search in which every fit succeeded but no fold could be
  scored stops with a message saying so.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` decide the task from the
  response the formula computes, as `tl_model()` now does, and treat
  `method = "logistic"` as classification whatever type the response is
  stored as. `factor(am) ~ wt + hp` is tuned as a classification and
  defaults to accuracy. The tuners read the raw 0/1 column, so in 0.5.0
  that search was a regression scored by rmse (1.084 for both sets on
  `mtcars`, `folds = 3`, `set.seed(1)`), and `metric = "accuracy"` was
  refused. They checked only for a factor or character response, so a
  0/1 numeric response with `method = "logistic"` defaulted to
  `"rmse"`, which a logistic model never produces, and the search failed
  with `Metric "rmse" was not produced for this task`.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` refuse a `param_grid` or
  `param_space` element without a name, or two elements with the same
  name. An unnamed candidate vector reached `tl_model()` positionally,
  where it was discarded, so `param_grid = list(c(0.01, 0.1))` fitted
  the default tree twice (rmse 4.656 for both on `mtcars`, `mpg ~ wt`,
  `folds = 3`, `set.seed(1)`) and returned an empty `best_params`.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` check `data`, `method`,
  `folds`, `metric`, `maximize` and `n_iter` before fitting anything,
  and the message names the argument. `metric = c("rmse", "mae")` failed
  with "the condition has length > 1", `folds = 2.5` with an rsample
  error about `v`, and a misspelt `method` warned on every fit before
  failing with "Unknown method: trees". `n_iter = 0` returned a fitted
  model with no error or warning, and `n_iter = 2.5` ran two iterations
  without a message; both are now errors.

* `tl_tune_grid()`, `tl_tune_random()`, `tl_tune_nn()` and
  `tl_tune_deep()` refuse `weights`, `subset`, `offset`, `foldid` and
  `strata` passed through `...`, as `tl_cv()` and `tl_compare_cv()` do.
  Each holds one value per row and cannot follow the rows into a fold.
  In 0.5.0 a tree search ignored the weights, a linear search warned
  "variable lengths differ" on every fold and still returned a model,
  and a forest search failed with "invalid 'length' argument". With
  `weights`, `tl_tune_nn()` failed with `..1 used in an incorrect
  context`, and `tl_tune_deep()` ran with keras ignoring them.
  `tl_tune_xgboost()` refuses the same arguments except `weights`, which
  it sets on the training `xgb.DMatrix()` and which `xgb.cv()` splits
  with the rows; a `subset` there reached xgboost as a parameter it does
  not use, and the tuning ran on every row.

* `tl_tune_random()` uses a single value as given. `sample(20, 1)` draws
  from `1:20`, so `param_space = list(minsplit = 20, cp = c(0.01, 0.1))`
  tried `minsplit` values of 3, 10 and 6 with `seed = 1`. A logical was
  drawn from `c(TRUE, FALSE)` whatever was supplied, so
  `importance = TRUE` came out `FALSE` in three draws of four. Logicals
  are now drawn from the values given. `tl_tune_random()` also accepts a
  list of candidates, such as `hidden_layers = list(10, c(20, 10))`, and
  `verbose = TRUE` no longer fails on a character parameter.

* Vector-valued grid candidates reach the model. The grid stores them in
  a list column, so the default `"deep"` grid passed
  `hidden_layers = list(c(10, 5))` and every multi-layer candidate
  failed.

* The large `"forest"` grid no longer includes `sampsize`, which
  randomForest reads as a number of rows and the grid gave as fractions
  from 0.5 to 1. For `method = "forest"` the tuners cap `mtry` at the
  number of predictors, counted the way randomForest counts them, with a
  warning; a matrix-valued term such as `poly(hp, 2)` counts once per
  column, since the forest is fitted on its columns. randomForest reset
  an oversized `mtry` in every fold while the results credited the value
  asked for. `y ~ . - id` does not count `id`: on
  `mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt", "hp", "qsec")]` plus an id column,
  `mpg ~ . - id` with `mtry = c(3, 4)` left 4 uncapped, randomForest
  reset it to 3 in every fold, and `best_params$mtry` reported 4 for a
  fit that used 3 (`folds = 3`, `set.seed(1)`). It is now capped at 3,
  and the duplicate set is evaluated once.

* `tl_default_param_grid("logistic")` returned the ridge `lambda` grid,
  which `glm()` does not accept, so every fit in a search over it
  failed. It now returns an empty grid with a warning pointing to
  `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"`.

* `tl_default_param_grid()` gives `"polynomial"` a `degree` grid, and
  says `"linear"` has nothing to tune; both used to warn "Unknown
  method". `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` name a parameter
  given no candidate values, which was reported as every set failing or
  as `invalid first argument`. In `tl_tune_random()` a whole-number
  range with equal ends, `c(20, 20)`, is the value 20 -- it drew from 1
  to 20 -- and a non-whole one is refused with a message that no longer
  advises writing `c(20.5, 20.5)` as `c(20.5, 20.5)`. A forest `mtry`
  below 1 is raised to 1, as randomForest does, so the results report
  the value used. `tl_plot_tuning_results()` on a one-parameter search
  explains that its default plot needs two parameters, where the
  message said `plot_type` must be one of "scatter", ... and had got
  "scatter".

* `tl_plot_tuning_results()` draws a parameter whose candidates are not
  single values, such as the deep grid's `hidden_layers` or an rpart
  `parms` list, as a categorical one labelled as the verbose messages
  print it. Every plot type failed on them, the default scatter
  included. A categorical parameter with one value among the scored sets
  has importance 0, where the importance plot stopped with "contrasts
  can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels". The parallel
  plot draws one line per set: sets with tied scores shared a rank and
  were drawn as one line.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` give `tl_model()`'s note about
  the response once per search, from the final fit, and
  `tl_compare_cv()` does not repeat it, as `tl_cv()` already did not.
  Every fold refit repeated it: a 2-set, 3-fold search on `mtcars` with
  `cyl ~ wt + hp` printed "Response 'cyl' has 3 unique numeric values"
  7 times, and comparing two such models over 3 folds printed it 6
  times. The warning that a numeric 0/1 response is converted to a
  factor for `method = "logistic"` is likewise given once per search,
  and not by `tl_compare_cv()`'s refits, which repeated it on every
  fold. Other warnings from the fits still come through.
  `tl_run_pipeline()`, `tl_auto_ml()` and `tl_stratified_models()` give
  the note about the response once per call as well: on the first ten
  rows of `mtcars`, a linear model and a tree of `mpg ~ wt` over 3 folds
  printed it 8 times, `tl_auto_ml(mtcars, cyl ~ wt + hp,
  time_budget = 10, cv_folds = 2)` 6 times, and
  `tl_stratified_models(mtcars, mpg ~ wt + hp, k = 3,
  supervised_method = "linear")` twice (`set.seed(1)`).

* `tl_cv()`, `tl_compare_cv()`, `tl_tune_grid()`, `tl_tune_random()`
  and `tl_run_pipeline()` warn once, before scoring, when every fold
  holds one row (`folds = nrow(data)`) and a metric being scored does
  not average to its leave-one-out value. rmse on one row is the
  absolute error, so the averaged rmse is the mean absolute error under
  rmse's name: 2.52 for a linear `mpg ~ wt` on `mtcars` with
  `folds = 32`, the same as mae, where the leave-one-out rmse is 3.20.
  The warning says so, and that precision, recall, sensitivity,
  specificity and f1 are undefined on folds whose one row leaves nothing
  to divide by, and rsq, auc and pr_auc on every fold. The per-fold
  warnings from yardstick that it explains are no longer repeated. The
  scores are unchanged, and a run scoring only accuracy, mae, mse or
  mape gets no warning.

* **`tl_tune_nn()` scores each two-class candidate by its own
  predictions.** Every candidate was scored as if it predicted the first
  class for every row, so on two-class `iris` with `set.seed(1)` and
  four folds every candidate scored 0.5, and the first in the grid
  always won. The candidates' errors are 0.04 to 0.06.

* `tl_tune_xgboost()` refits its final model through `tl_model()`, so
  the model records the tuned settings in `$spec$args` and
  `tl_compare_cv()` refits each fold at them. It refitted at xgboost's
  defaults: a model tuned to `max_depth = 1, eta = 0.01` scored fold for
  fold the same as the default model. Arguments in `...` that `xgb.cv()`
  takes go to it alone, and booster settings join every parameter set
  and the final fit; `showsd = FALSE` had reached the final
  `xgb.train()`, which warned that it did not recognise it. Case
  `weights` apply to the cross-validation and the final fit.

* `tl_compare_cv()` refits each model with the arguments it was built
  with. It refitted from the formula and method alone, so every model
  was scored at its method's defaults: a tree with `cp = 0.5` and one
  with `cp = 0.0001, minsplit = 2` produced identical fold scores.
  Models now record their fitting arguments in `$spec$args`; arguments
  passed to `tl_compare_cv()` override them. A model fitted with
  `weights`, `subset`, `offset`, `foldid` or `strata` is refused, since
  those hold one value per training row and cannot follow the rows into
  a fold. Those are recorded by name only, in `$spec$per_row_args`, so a
  model does not carry a second copy of its weights.

* `tl_compare_cv()` refuses a model that a refit from its formula,
  method and arguments would not reproduce: one built by
  `tl_semisupervised()` or `tl_anomaly_aware()`, or a `tl_auto_ml()`
  candidate fitted on PCA scores or cluster labels. A semi-supervised
  model trained on 15 labels was scored as a tree fitted on every
  training-fold label (accuracy 0.947 on `iris`, `folds = 3`,
  `set.seed(1)`), and an anomaly-aware model with `action = "flag"`
  failed with "variable lengths differ (found for 'is_anomaly')".

* `tl_compare_cv()` checks its arguments before fitting anything. A
  metric name it does not compute for the task is refused with the
  message `tl_evaluate()` gives: a misspelt `"acuracy"` was dropped from
  the summary without a message, and `metrics = "rmse"` on a
  classification model returned an empty summary.
  `tl_compare_cv(mtcars, list())` failed with "argument is not
  interpretable as logical", a single model passed without `list()` was
  read as three models that were not tidylearn models, and an
  unsupervised model failed the task check; each now gets a message
  saying what to pass.

* `tl_compare_cv()` refuses repeated model names and names an unnamed
  entry `Model_<i>`, numbered on (`Model_1.1`) if the caller already
  chose that name. Results are keyed on the name, so
  `list(a = m1, a = m2)` pooled both models' folds into one summary row,
  and a partly named list produced a model called `""`.

* `tl_compare_cv()` reports `NA` where it has no value. A fold none of
  whose rows can be scored, such as one where every predictor is
  missing, has `NA` for each metric in `fold_metrics`, with a warning
  naming the fold and the model; in 0.5.0 it scored `NaN` and was left
  out of the summary without a message. A metric with no value on any
  fold summarises as `NA`: its `mean_value` was `NaN`, and its
  `min_value` and `max_value` were `Inf` and `-Inf` with a warning each.
  `tl_cv()` reports such a metric's mean as `NA` too, as its note said
  it did: rsq on `data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 3)` with `folds = 5`
  summarised as mean `NaN`.

* `tl_step_selection()` with `direction = "forward"` or `"both"` works
  with a formula using `.`, and keeps a transformed response, the
  formula's `offset()` terms and its intercept setting. It returned the
  intercept-only model for any formula using `.`: `step()` expanded the
  dot against the starting model's `1`, which left no terms to add. The
  formula is now expanded against the data first. The starting model
  was built from the response's variable name, so
  `log(mpg) ~ wt + hp + qsec` selected a model of `mpg`,
  `mpg ~ wt + hp + offset(qsec)` returned `mpg ~ wt + hp` with no
  offset, and `mpg ~ wt + hp - 1` came back with an intercept. The last
  two now give `mpg ~ wt + offset(qsec)` and `mpg ~ wt - 1`, as backward
  selection did.

* **`tl_step_selection()` fits every candidate model on the rows with no
  missing value in the formula's variables, and a message gives the
  count.** A variable with missing values changed the row count as it
  entered or left, so backward and both-direction selection stopped with
  "number of rows in use has changed: remove missing values?", and
  forward selection compared the candidates on the complete rows, then
  returned a model fitted on more: with three missing values in a noise
  column added to `mtcars`, it compared on 29 rows and fitted on 32. The
  model keeps the data passed in, and the rows left out are recorded in
  the fit's `na.action`.

* `tl_step_selection(criterion = "BIC")` penalises by the rows the model
  used. `log(nrow(data))` counted rows `lm()` dropped for missing
  values, which could change the model selected. Forward and `"both"`
  selection also find a variable the formula takes from the caller's
  environment.

* `tl_step_selection()` refuses a categorical response, saying that it
  selects linear models. A factor such as `Species`, or one the formula
  makes with `factor(am)`, had its codes fitted until `step()` stopped
  with "AIC is -infinity for this model, so 'step' cannot proceed".

* `tl_test_model_difference()` accepts `test = "wilcox.test"` as
  `"wilcox"`. The diagnostics vignette recommended `"wilcox.test"` at
  small fold counts, a value the function rejected; it now uses
  `test = "wilcox"`. The vignette and the help page give the fold count
  the exact signed-rank test needs: the smallest two-sided p-value over
  n folds is 2 / 2^n, which is 0.0625 at the vignette's 5 folds, so it
  takes 6 to reach p < 0.05.

* **`tl_test_model_difference()` pairs the two models' scores by fold
  and uses the folds both have a value for, in the test and in
  `mean_diff`.** `mean_diff` was each model's mean over its own scored
  folds: for fold scores (0.5, 0.6, NA, 0.8) and (0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6) it
  was 0.017, where the mean paired difference is -0.067. A comparison
  with fewer than two such folds has an `NA` p-value, with a warning;
  `t.test()` stopped there, which discarded every other metric's result.

### Pipelines, AutoML and integration

* **`tl_run_pipeline()` standardises a numeric predictor only where the
  model the formula describes stays the same.** It leaves alone a
  column used inside a function call, such as `log()`, `poly()`, `I()`
  or `offset()`; every column of a formula without an intercept; and the
  columns of an interaction whose lower-order terms are not all in the
  formula. Other plain terms are standardised as before. The formula was
  evaluated on the standardised columns, so `mpg ~ log(hp) + wt` on
  `mtcars` took the log of negative z-scores, warned "NaNs produced",
  fitted the final `lm()` on 15 of the 32 rows (a `log(hp)` coefficient
  of -0.22, where `lm()` gives -5.92), and `tl_predict_pipeline()`
  returned `NaN` for 5 of the first 6 cars. `mpg ~ wt + offset(0.05 *
  hp)` applied the offset per standard deviation of `hp`, and its
  predictions were up to 8.5 mpg from those of `lm()` on the same
  formula; `mpg ~ wt - 1` fitted a line through a different origin. On
  data without missing values, a `"linear"` or `"logistic"` pipeline now
  predicts what `lm()` or `glm()` predicts for the same formula.

* **`tl_run_pipeline()` with `validation = "split"` stores the training
  split's statistics in `$preprocessing_stats` and the preprocessed
  training split in `$processed_data`, since the models it keeps were
  fitted there.** Both held full-data values, so `tl_predict_pipeline()`
  centred `wt` on 3.217 (all 32 rows of `mtcars`) for a model fitted
  under 3.279 (its 22 training rows), and its predictions for the test
  rows were up to 0.685 mpg from the ones the model was scored on
  (`set.seed(3)`). They now match.

* `tl_pipeline()` and `tl_auto_ml()` take the task from the response the
  formula computes, as `tl_model()` does. They read it off the raw
  column, so `factor(am) ~ wt + hp` on `mtcars` ran as a regression of
  `am`'s 0/1 codes: the pipeline scored its tree by rmse, and AutoML
  chose the task "regression" and ranked its candidates by rmse. Both
  now fit and score a classification.

* **Best-model selection in `tl_run_pipeline()` treats `sensitivity`,
  `specificity` and `pr_auc` as higher-is-better.** They were ranked
  lowest-first, so `best_metric = "sensitivity"` on two-class iris chose
  a `cp = 1` stump scoring 0.400 over a tree scoring 0.898
  (`set.seed(10)`). The `higher_better` column of
  `tl_compare_pipeline_models()`'s plot data does the same, and no
  longer marks a multiclass run's `auc_<class>` rows lower-is-better.
  The pipeline, its comparison plot and the `tl_auto_ml()` leaderboard
  now take the direction from one list.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` warns about a cross-validation fold with no row it
  can score, such as one where every response is missing, and averages
  the model's scores over the other folds. The fold's scores came back
  `NaN` and were dropped from the average without a message. With
  `validation = "split"` an unscorable test set is now an error, since
  there is nothing else to score; its scores were `NaN`, and the run
  warned that every value was `NA` and returned the first model.

* `tl_pipeline()` refuses an argument it does not take, and
  `preprocessing = list(dummy_encode = FALSE)`. A misspelt argument was
  swallowed by `...`: `evalution = list(cv_folds = 2)` left `cv_folds`
  at 5. `dummy_encode = FALSE` ran the same models as `TRUE`, because
  each model's fitting function encodes factors itself.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` and `tl_stratified_models()` give the logistic
  "Converting response variable to factor" warning once per call. They
  refit once per fold, model and cluster, and repeated it each time: two
  logistic specs over three folds on a 0/1 response warned eight times.

* `predict()` and `tl_evaluate()` on one of `tl_auto_ml()`'s `pca_*`
  candidates accept the model's own stored data, which holds the
  component scores in place of the raw columns, and `tl_evaluate()` and
  `summary()` score that data for any model fitted on engineered
  features. Passing it back (`tl_evaluate(model, model$data)`, or a plot
  that defaults to it) projected it a second time and failed with "PCA
  was fitted on 4 column(s) ... but new_data is missing". When
  `tl_auto_ml()` fell back to training scores, those candidates dropped
  off the leaderboard.

* `tl_auto_ml()` checks `task` and `metric` before fitting anything.
  `metric` must be one of the task's metrics that `tl_evaluate()`
  computes: `"sensitivity"` and `"specificity"` were refused only after
  every candidate had been fitted, and `"roc_auc"`, `"kap"`,
  `"logloss"` and `"mlogloss"` were accepted but never computed, so
  every score was `NA` and the first model came back. `task` must be
  `"auto"`, `"classification"` or `"regression"` and agree with the
  response: `task = "Classification"` fitted the regression methods to a
  factor and scored every one `NA`, and `tl_auto_ml(mtcars, am ~ wt +
  hp, task = "classification")`, which ran, is refused because `am` is
  numeric and every candidate but logistic regression fits it as a
  regression; write the response as `factor(am)` instead. A formula
  response that is not a column of `data` is refused as well; every fit
  used to fail, leaving an empty leaderboard.

* `tl_auto_ml()` builds its PCA and cluster candidates from the
  predictors the formula names, and fits the cluster candidates with the
  cluster column added to the formula's terms. The rotation and the
  k-means centres were fitted on every column but the response, so
  `Species ~ . - id` on iris put the excluded row id into both, and iris
  is sorted by class, so the id carries the class. With an explicit
  right-hand side, `Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width`, the PCA used
  all four measurements, and the clustered candidates left the cluster
  column out of their formula, so `clustered_tree` predicted exactly
  what `baseline_tree` did. The number of clusters for a classification
  task counts the observed classes; a missing response value was counted
  as one.

* **`tl_explore()` keeps `max_components` principal components.** It
  kept every component, so `max_components = 2` on iris gave 4, and the
  default on `mtcars` gave 11 where it now gives 5. `k_range` must hold
  whole numbers from 2 to one less than the number of rows;
  `k_range = 1:3` failed with "incorrect number of dimensions".

* `tl_transfer_learning()` takes a string formula and an explicit
  right-hand side, fits its PCA on the predictors the formula names, and
  accepts `pretrain_method = "pca"` only. A string gave "Response
  variable 'NA' not found"; `Species ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Length`
  failed with "object 'Sepal.Length' not found", because the tree was
  fitted on the component scores under the raw-column formula; the
  documented `"autoencoder"` gave "Unknown method"; and an `"mds"` fit
  could not project the rows `predict()` was given.

* `tl_reduce_dimensions()` names an unusable `method` or
  `n_components`: `method = "kmeans"` failed with "object 'transformed'
  not found", and `n_components = 6` on iris with "Elements PC5 and PC6
  don't exist". `tl_compare_pipeline_models()` names a requested metric
  the run did not score, which failed inside ggplot2's faceting.
  `summary()` of a run pipeline printed the best model's summary twice;
  it prints it once.

* `tl_semisupervised()` refuses a numeric response. Labels are
  propagated by majority vote within a cluster, and the response was
  passed through `factor()`, so `mpg ~ .` was fitted as a classification
  with one class per distinct value. The response is the one the
  formula computes, so `factor(am) ~ wt + hp + qsec` is accepted and
  `log(mpg) ~ wt + hp` refused as numeric. A computed logical such as
  `I(mpg > 20)`, which `tl_model()` fits as a regression, is refused
  with a pointer to `factor()`, and so is a response that does not
  compute the propagated labels back from the column's values, such as
  `cut(mpg, 2)`, whose breaks follow the column's range.

* `tl_semisupervised()` warns about rows whose cluster holds no labelled
  observation, and leaves them out of training. They were given `NA`
  labels and dropped when the model was fitted, without a message; with
  six labels from two iris classes, 53 of 150 rows went that way. The
  count is in `$semisupervised_info$n_unlabelled_dropped`. Labelled rows
  whose label is missing are left out of the vote. A cluster whose
  labelled rows all had missing labels gave all its rows the response's
  first level: with the labelled setosa rows set to `NA` and levels
  `c("virginica", "versicolor", "setosa")`, the 45 unlabelled setosa
  rows were trained as virginica (`set.seed(2)`), and for a character
  response the same call failed with "Can't combine NULL and non NULL
  results". Those rows are now left out of training too, and the warning
  gives unlabelled rows and rows with a missing label separately. k is
  set to the number of classes the labelled rows carry, and labelled
  rows from fewer than two classes are refused. A logical
  `labeled_indices` and a string formula are also accepted now; the
  logical was matched as the positions 0 and 1.

* **`tl_semisupervised()` keeps the response's level order.** The
  pseudo-labels were re-sorted alphabetically, so with levels
  `c("virginica", "versicolor")` the model came back with versicolor
  first and virginica as the positive class: a logistic model's `.pred`
  for the first versicolor row was 0.001, where it is now 0.999
  (`set.seed(1)`).

* **`tl_semisupervised()`, `tl_stratified_models()` and
  `tl_anomaly_aware()` cluster, or look for anomalies, on the predictors
  the formula names, so their results change for any formula that
  leaves columns of `data` out.** They used every column but the
  response, so a column the formula excludes took part: with a row id
  added to iris and `Species ~ . - id`, the id was one of the k-means
  columns.

* `tl_add_cluster_features(method = "hclust")` takes `k`. It was passed
  on to the tree fit, which has no `k`, so every value but the fallback
  failed with `unused argument (k = 4)`.
  `tl_semisupervised(cluster_method = "hclust")` failed the same way on
  every call, and now cuts the tree.

* `tl_stratified_models()` takes `cluster_method = "kmeans"`, `"pam"`,
  `"clara"` or `"hclust"`, whose tree is cut at `k`. `"hclust"` and
  `"dbscan"` failed with "unused argument (k = 2)", and a `"pam"` fit
  could not predict even its own training rows. The training rows'
  assignments are stored in `$clusters`, which `predict()` uses when
  `new_data` is `NULL`. `"dbscan"`, which picks its own number of
  clusters, is refused by name here and in `tl_semisupervised()`, where
  it failed the same way.

* `tl_stratified_models()` handles a cluster whose rows all hold one
  class. Every classifier refuses a one-class response, so
  `tl_stratified_models(iris, Species ~ ., k = 3)` failed
  (`set.seed(1)`): k-means puts the 50 setosa rows in a cluster of their
  own. That cluster now gets no model and is listed in
  `$single_class_clusters`, `predict()` returns its class for its rows
  (probability 1 under `type = "prob"`), and the other clusters' models
  are built as before. This holds for a response the formula computes,
  such as `factor(am)`, whose single-class clusters were not found.

* `predict()` on a `tl_stratified_models()` result returns what each
  cluster's model returns for the requested `type`. With
  `type = "prob"` it returned only `.cluster`, with a warning per row.
  Class levels and probability columns follow the classes in the
  training data: they had followed whichever rows came first, so the
  second level -- the positive class -- changed with row order, and a
  class one cluster never saw had probability `NA` where it now has 0.

* `predict()` on a `tl_stratified_models()` result works on data without
  the response column. It selected the response out by name and failed
  with `Element mpg doesn't exist`.

* **`tl_anomaly_aware(action = "downweight")` now changes the model.**
  With the default `"tree"` the weights went to `rpart.control()`, which
  ignored them, so the fit was identical to the unweighted tree; with
  `"linear"`, `"boost"` and `"nn"` the call failed with `..1 used in an
  incorrect context`; `"xgboost"` warned "Passed unrecognized
  parameters: weights" and fitted without them, so its downweighted fits
  change; and `"svm"` ignored the weights. It now requires a
  `supervised_method` that applies case weights -- `"linear"`,
  `"polynomial"`, `"logistic"`, `"tree"`, `"ridge"`, `"lasso"`,
  `"elastic_net"`, `"forest"`, `"boost"`, `"nn"` or `"xgboost"` -- and
  refuses `"svm"` and `"deep"`, which take no case weights. The
  `"boost"`, `"nn"` and `"xgboost"` fits match `gbm::gbm()`,
  `nnet::nnet()` and `xgboost::xgb.train()` given the same weights. A
  forest reads them as sampling weights.

* `tl_anomaly_aware(action = "flag")` adds the flag to the formula as
  written. It rebuilt the formula from its variable names, so
  `Species ~ . - Sepal.Width` put `Sepal.Width` back in as a predictor
  and `mpg ~ poly(wt, 2)` was fitted as `mpg ~ wt`.

* `tl_anomaly_aware()` stops when DBSCAN marks every row as noise,
  naming `eps`, `minPts` and the unscaled predictors. At the default
  `eps = 0.5`, all 32 rows of `mtcars` are noise for `mpg ~ wt + hp`:
  `action = "remove"` failed in `lm()` with "0 (non-NA) cases",
  `"downweight"` failed with "..1 used in an incorrect context", and
  `"flag"` returned a model whose `is_anomaly` coefficient was `NA`.

* `tl_anomaly_aware()` names an invalid `action`, which failed with
  `object 'model' not found`, and no longer documents an
  `"isolation_forest"` method it never had.

### Preprocessing, interactions and diagnostics

* `tl_split(stratify = )` splits rows whose stratify value is missing.
  `split()` drops an `NA` group, so those rows were never drawn and all
  went to test. They now form a stratum of their own. `tl_split()` on a
  one-column data frame also returns data frames in place of bare
  vectors.

* `tl_split()` refuses a `stratify` that is not the name of one column.
  `stratify = c("am", "vs")` failed with `the condition has length > 1`,
  and an unknown column is now named in the error.

* `tl_split()` refuses a `prop` outside (0, 1). `prop = 1.5` split 32
  rows 31/1, because each side is kept to at least one row.

* `tl_prepare_data()` imputes with the method it names. `"mode"` and
  `"knn"` both used the mean while the message reported the method asked
  for; `"mode"` is now implemented and anything else is refused. A
  missing value in a factor or character column was never imputed, and
  with more than two levels it broke one-hot encoding with `Can't
  recycle ..1 (size 150) to match ..2 (size 148)`. Categorical gaps now
  take the column's most frequent value.

* `tl_prepare_data(remove_correlated = TRUE)` removes the feature that
  clears a correlated group, where it removed the ones around it. Every
  pair was decided separately against a half-zeroed matrix, so for a
  chain `x1 - x2 - x3` it dropped `x1` and `x3` and kept `x2`, the one
  feature correlated with both. Features are now removed one at a time,
  the most correlated pair first.

* `tl_prepare_data()` processes only the formula's predictors. It read
  the formula for the response alone, so `y ~ . - id` one-hot encoded
  `id` into twenty columns. A column the formula excludes is now
  returned unchanged. `tl_model()` shares that formula reading to record
  the training levels of factor predictors, and for a formula using `.`
  it recorded none.

* `tl_prepare_data()` refuses two inputs it used to misread. A
  `scale_method` it does not have, such as `"zscore"`, reported "Scaling
  numeric features using method: zscore" and returned the data unscaled.
  A formula with no response, such as `~ x1 + x2`, took its first
  predictor as the response and passed it through unscaled.

* `tl_prepare_data()` refuses a `correlation_cutoff` that is not a
  single number greater than 0 and at most 1. No correlation exceeds 1,
  so a cutoff of 95, meant as a percentage, made
  `remove_correlated = TRUE` remove nothing without a message.

* `tl_prepare_data()` no longer stops on an entirely missing numeric
  column with `remove_zero_variance = FALSE`, on an entirely missing
  factor (`Can't recycle ..1 (size 6) to match ..2 (size 0)`), on a
  single row or a column holding an `Inf` (both `Selections can't have
  missing values`), or on a grouped tibble (`mpg must be size 11 or 1,
  not 32`). The missing factor is left as it is, a column whose spread
  is not finite is left unscaled, and a grouped tibble is prepared as a
  whole and returned ungrouped. A response that is not a column of the
  data is named in the error: `mgp ~ .` failed with dplyr's `Element mgp
  doesn't exist`. Its documentation says the statistics come from the
  data passed in, so preparing before splitting lets test rows shape
  them.

* `tl_prepare_data()` reports encoding, and records an encoding step,
  only for the variables it splits into dummy columns. A two-level
  factor is left as it is, yet one alone gave "Encoding 1 categorical
  variables". Imputing and scaling are likewise reported and recorded
  only when a column is filled or scaled.

* `tl_auto_interactions()` honours `exclude_vars`. It computed the
  reduced predictor set and never used it, so with a strong `a:z` effect
  `exclude_vars = "z"` still returned `y ~ a + b + z + a:z`. A name in
  `exclude_vars` that is not a predictor in the formula is now an error.
  With a `y ~ .` formula the function failed in its testing step, and
  now works. When every pair is already in the formula it returns the
  model as specified, with a message.

* `tl_auto_interactions(top_n = 0)` adds no interaction.
  `significant[1:0, ]` selected the first row, so `top_n = 0` still
  returned `y ~ a + b + z + a:z`. `top_n` must now be a single whole
  number of 0 or more. The `interaction_tests` and
  `selected_interactions` attributes are set on every returned model, as
  documented; they were missing when nothing was significant or nothing
  was left to test.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` and `tl_plot_interaction()` accept a model
  fitted with `y ~ .`, which failed with `Variables not found in model
  formula`. `tl_interaction_effects()` also stopped repeating grid
  blocks when quartiles of `by_var` tie: `mpg ~ wt * cyl` gave five
  slopes for three values of `cyl`, and now gives one each, labelled
  with the quartiles it stands for.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` and `tl_plot_interaction()` report a
  classification model on the probability of its second class. A forest
  or tree classifier predicts the class label by default, so `fit` was a
  factor and the slopes were fitted to class labels (0.390 to 0.482 for
  a two-class iris forest fitted after `set.seed(1)`, under a run of
  warnings), and a contour plot of two numeric variables failed with
  `'range' not meaningful for factors`. A model with more than two
  classes is refused. A logistic model's values are unchanged.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` and `tl_plot_interaction()` refuse a model
  variable that shares a name with a column they write their results
  to: `fit`, `by_value` and `by_label`, and with intervals `lower` and
  `upper`, for the effects; `prediction`, and with a band `.lower` and
  `.upper`, for the plot. The results overwrote the variable:
  `var = "fit"` on `mpg ~ fit * hp` failed with `subscript out of
  bounds`, a `by_var` named `fit` or a held variable named `lower` came
  back replaced by the predictions or the interval, and a variable named
  `prediction` was plotted as the predictions themselves.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` refuses a constant `var`, which failed with
  `subscript out of bounds`, and `tl_plot_interaction()` refuses a
  `type` argument: `type = "class"` drew class codes over a probability
  band.

* `tl_plot_interaction(confidence = TRUE)` draws the confidence band.
  The band came from `predict()`, which returns no interval, so none was
  ever drawn. It now comes from the `lm` or `glm` fit, for numeric by
  categorical plots; a model without standard errors gets a message.

* `tl_test_interactions()` accepts a `.` formula and a string formula,
  and stops with a message naming the formula's predictors when a type
  filter leaves no pairs. These failed with messages such as `undefined
  columns selected` and `argument 1 is not a vector`. It no longer
  re-tests a pair whose interaction the formula already has, which came
  back as a row of `NA`, and it refuses a formula with no response,
  whose first predictor it treated as the response.

* `tl_test_interactions()` and `tl_auto_interactions()` no longer treat
  the variable inside an `offset()` as a candidate predictor. For
  `mpg ~ wt + hp + offset(log(disp))`, `tl_test_interactions()` also
  tested `hp:disp` and `wt:disp`, and `tl_auto_interactions()` could add
  an interaction with the offset's variable, returning formulas such as
  `y ~ a + b + a:e + offset(log(e))`.

* `tl_test_interactions()` and `tl_auto_interactions()` refuse a
  categorical response. `lm()` cannot fit one, and a two-class factor
  response returned a row of `NaN` after a run of warnings. A logical
  response is still fitted as 0/1.

* A non-syntactic column name, such as `car weight`, works in
  `tl_detect_outliers(method = "cook")`, as `var` in
  `tl_interaction_effects()`, and as `var1` or `var2` in
  `tl_test_interactions()`. Each pasted the name into formula text,
  which failed with `unexpected symbol`.

* **`tl_check_assumptions()` reads a factor's generalised VIF on the
  scale of an ordinary one.** `car::vif()` returns a table of GVIF, Df
  and GVIF^(1/(2*Df)) when a term has more than one degree of freedom,
  and the maximum was taken over the whole table: `mpg ~ wt + carb` with
  `carb` a six-level factor reported "Maximum VIF: 5" and
  multicollinearity, from `carb`'s 5 df, while both GVIFs are 1.6. The
  check now uses GVIF^(1/Df), which equals the VIF for a one-df term.

* **`tl_check_assumptions()` no longer tests a logistic model for normal
  residuals or constant variance, neither of which logistic regression
  assumes.** Shapiro-Wilk on the deviance residuals of `am ~ wt + hp`
  gave p = 0 with advice to transform the response, and
  `lmtest::bptest()` tested a linear probability model. Both checks now
  have a `NULL` check and a note saying why, so that model goes from 3
  violations in 6 checks to 2 in 4.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` counts a check its test could not decide as
  neither satisfied nor violated. A model with fewer than four distinct
  fitted values leaves the linearity check `NA`, and the verbose summary
  failed with `missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed`; with
  `verbose = FALSE` the status read "NA assumption(s) appear to be
  violated". Such a check is now reported as UNKNOWN. A one-factor model
  such as `len ~ supp` has two fitted values that floating-point noise
  made look like four, so its linearity test ran and reported p = 1; it
  is now `NA` too.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` always returns its multicollinearity check.
  When `car::vif()` could not run, the fallback result was assigned
  inside the error handler and lost, so `mpg ~ wt` came back with no
  `multicollinearity` element and five checks instead of six. The
  fallback counts the fit's terms, so a `y ~ .` formula is no longer
  read as one predictor.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` no longer advances the session's random
  number stream. It called `car::durbinWatsonTest()`, which bootstraps a
  p-value the function never read. The Durbin-Watson statistic is now
  computed directly, matches `lmtest::dwtest()`, and is reported whether
  or not car is installed.

* `tl_influence_measures()` works on a rank-deficient fit and on one
  fitted with `na.action = na.exclude`. `dfbetas()` has no column for an
  aliased coefficient, and looping over `coef()` failed with `subscript
  out of bounds`; under `na.exclude` every measure is padded back to all
  rows, and building the result failed with `arguments imply differing
  number of rows: 30, 32` (`116, 153` for `Ozone ~ Temp + Wind` on
  `airquality`). `tl_check_assumptions()` failed on both fits too: with
  `subscript out of bounds` on the rank-deficient one and `residuals
  include missing values` under `na.exclude`. The default thresholds
  count the coefficients the fit estimated.

* **`tl_detect_outliers()` flags and counts the right rows when a value
  is missing.** With `method = "cook"` the fit dropped the incomplete
  row and its 31 distances were recycled into a 32-row flag matrix: one
  missing `wt` in `mtcars` flagged nine rows where four have a Cook's
  distance above 4/32. Those four are now flagged, and the incomplete
  row's flags are `NA`. For every method `any_outlier` and
  `outlier_counts$total` skip a missing flag: on `airquality` the total
  was `NA` while `outlier_indices` listed five rows, and it is now 5. A
  single row no longer fails with `dim(X) must have a positive length`
  under `"iqr"` or `"z-score"`.

* `tl_diagnostic_dashboard()` refuses a model whose fit is not an `lm`
  or `glm` before drawing anything. A tree failed partway through with
  `no applicable method for 'rstandard' applied to an object of class
  "rpart"`.

### Unsupervised learning

* A one-sided formula for an unsupervised method names columns only. A
  term such as `log(Sepal.Length)` is an error naming it; PCA used to
  run on the raw column instead, centred at 5.84, the mean of
  `Sepal.Length` itself. `~ . - x` now means every numeric column but
  `x`, where it failed with "undefined columns selected". A name that is
  not a column of the data, as in `~ wt + zz`, or `~ . + z` with `z` in
  the caller's session, is an error that names it; it failed with
  "undefined columns selected" too.

* `tl_model()` warns, naming the column, when an unsupervised formula
  names a non-numeric column the method cannot use: any such column for
  `"kmeans"`, `"pca"` and `"clara"`, and for `"mds"`, `"pam"`,
  `"hclust"` and `"dbscan"` unless the distance is Gower.
  `~ Sepal.Length + Species` clustered on Sepal.Length alone, and PCA
  returned two components for three named columns, without a message.
  The fit is unchanged. For the four methods that take a distance the
  warning points to the Gower distance, which uses the column; a `~ .`
  formula still means the numeric columns and stays quiet.

  A non-numeric column selected by `cols` is left out with a warning
  naming it wherever the method uses numeric columns only, which is
  everywhere but a Gower distance, and a selection with no numeric
  column is refused by name. `tidy_kmeans()`, `tidy_pca()`,
  `tidy_knn_dist()` and `tidy_dbscan()` failed on such a column inside
  their backends (`NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call`, `'x' must be
  numeric or complex`, `x has to be a numeric matrix`, `all data in x
  has to be numeric`), `tidy_hclust()`, `tidy_pam()` and `tidy_dist()`
  dropped it from the distance without a message while `tidy_pam()`'s
  `$medoids` and `tidy_hclust()`'s `$data` kept it (both now leave it
  out), and
  `tidy_dist(iris, cols = "Species")` returned a distance matrix of
  `NA`, which `tidy_hclust()` and `tidy_pam()` then refused as missing
  values. `tidy_dist()`, and so `tidy_mds()`, refuse data with no
  numeric column in the same words.

* **The unsupervised functions ignore dplyr grouping.** Selecting the
  numeric columns of a grouped tibble brought the grouping variable back
  ("Adding missing grouping variables"), so on `group_by(iris, Species)`
  `tidy_clara()` clustered on Species' factor codes and partitioned 14
  of 150 rows differently, `tidy_hclust()` and `tidy_mds()` worked from
  distances 1.118 times too large (Species coerced to `NA`),
  `tl_model(method = "kmeans")`, `calc_wss()`, `tidy_gap_stat()` and
  `tidy_silhouette_analysis()` failed with `NA/NaN/Inf in foreign
  function call`, `tidy_dbscan()` with `all data in x has to be
  numeric`, `tidy_knn_dist()` with `x has to be a numeric matrix`, and
  `calc_validation_metrics()` with `'x' must be numeric or complex`. A
  grouped tibble now gives the fit of the same data ungrouped, through
  `tl_model()` and the `tidy_*()`, distance, k-NN and validation
  helpers.

* **`tidy_dbscan()` and `tl_model(method = "dbscan")` cluster on the
  `distance` asked for.** It was ignored: on `iris[, 1:4]` with
  `eps = 0.5` and `minPts = 5`, `distance = "manhattan"` gave the
  Euclidean answer of 2 clusters and 17 noise points, where
  `dbscan::dbscan()` on Manhattan distances finds 3 clusters and 91
  noise points. Any method `stats::dist()` accepts works, and `"gower"`.

* **Gower distance uses the factor columns the caller selected.**
  `tidy_hclust(distance = "gower")` and
  `tl_model(method = "hclust", distance = "gower")` kept only the
  numeric columns, with or without a formula, so even a factor named in
  `~ num + fac` never reached the distance. For PAM with
  `metric = "gower"`, `~ .` expanded to the numeric columns, and the fit
  disagreed with the no-formula one on 8 of 20 rows of a mixed example.
  With Gower, no selection and `~ .` mean every column, `~ . - x` every
  column but `x`, and the heights and clusterings match
  `cluster::daisy()`'s distances. `tidy_dbscan(distance = "gower")`
  takes every column the same way.

* **`tidy_gower()` gives `NA` for a pair of rows with no variable
  observed in both, as `cluster::daisy()` does.** It gave 0, so
  `tidy_gower(data.frame(x = c(1, NA, 3), y = c(NA, 2, 5)))` called rows
  1 and 2 identical and `tidy_pam()` grouped them together. `tidy_pam()`
  and `tidy_hclust()` now stop on undefined distances and name the pairs
  of rows, where they clustered them as identical.

* `tidy_dbscan()` names what is missing when its data has missing
  values: on coordinates, the columns holding them; on any other
  distance, the pairs of rows with no variable observed in both.
  `dbscan()` stopped with `data/distances cannot contain NAs for dbscan
  (with kd-tree)!`. Missing values that leave every pair a shared
  variable cluster on a distance that tolerates them, such as
  `"manhattan"`.

* **`calc_validation_metrics()` leaves DBSCAN noise (cluster 0) out of
  every measure, and reports it in a new `n_noise` column, so
  `compare_clusterings()` gains the column too.** Only `k` excluded
  noise before. For `tidy_dbscan(iris[, 1:4], eps = 0.5, minPts = 5)`,
  whose clusters hold 49 and 84 rows, it reported `min_size` 17 (the
  noise count), `avg_size` 50, average silhouette 0.486 and total WSS
  170.5; it now reports 49, 66.5, 0.735 and 90.7. A single cluster gives
  `NA` silhouette columns where it failed with `incorrect number of
  dimensions`.

* `calc_validation_metrics()`, `compare_clusterings()` and
  `tidy_silhouette()` accept factor and character cluster labels.
  `cluster::silhouette()` refused them with `'round' not meaningful for
  factors`, which turned away the `cluster` column of
  `augment_kmeans()`'s own output. Labels that read as whole numbers
  keep their values, so `augment_dbscan()`'s `"0"` is still noise;
  `tidy_silhouette()` reports other labels as given.

* `calc_validation_metrics()` refuses `data` with no numeric column,
  where it summed squares over no columns and reported `total_wss = 0`,
  a perfect score: `calc_validation_metrics(rep(1:3, each = 50),
  iris["Species"])` gave 0 where `iris[, 1:4]` gives 89.30.
  `compare_clusterings()` refuses the same data, where it also reported
  0 with a `dist_mat`, or failed inside `silhouette()` with
  `NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call` without one. Given a `dist_mat`
  and no `data`, the silhouette is still scored on its own.

* **`tidy_gap_stat()`'s `k_firstmax` is the first local maximum of the
  gap, `cluster::maxSE(method = "firstmax")`.** It was computed with
  `which.max()`, maxSE's `"globalmax"`, so it always equalled
  `k_globalmax`: 8 for `iris[, 1:4]` with `max_k = 8`, `B = 10`,
  `nstart = 5` and `set.seed(1)`, where firstmax gives 5. `print()`
  labels globalmax as the most liberal of the three and firstmax as the
  middle ground.

* `optimal_hclust_k(method = "gap")` refuses a tree built with
  `distance = "gower"` on non-numeric columns, naming them and pointing
  to `method = "silhouette"`. `clusGap()` draws its reference data
  uniformly over each numeric column, so the refit dropped the factors
  and returned a gap curve for clusterings the tree never made. A Gower
  tree on numeric columns, and a tree on any other distance, are
  unaffected.

* **`suggest_eps()` reads the k-NN distance at `k = minPts - 1`, the
  neighbours a core point needs besides itself, as
  `dbscan::kNNdistplot(minPts = )` does.** It used `k = minPts`, the
  radius for one more neighbour: `suggest_eps(iris[, 1:4],
  minPts = 5)$eps` was 0.758 and is now 0.718, the 95th percentile of
  `dbscan::kNNdist(k = 4)`. `minPts` below 2 is an error.

* **`tidy_pca(method = "princomp", center = FALSE)` warns that
  `princomp()` always centres and records `center = TRUE` in
  `$settings`.** It returned centred scores while `$settings$center`
  said `FALSE`.

* `tidy_mds()` returns the dimensions classical MDS supports when `ndim`
  asks for more: `cmdscale()` keeps only dimensions with a positive
  eigenvalue, and naming `ndim` columns failed with `length of
  'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent`. `ndim` outside 1 to n - 1
  is refused by name. `print()` on a `tidy_mds` result counts its `Dim`
  columns: a fit on a tibble, which has no row labels, printed
  "Dimensions: 1" for two.

* `tidy_clara()` refuses a dist object with a message pointing to
  `tidy_pam()`. It passed the distances to `cluster::clara()`, which
  samples observations and takes no distance matrix, and failed there
  with `'x' is a "dist" object, but should be a data matrix or frame`.

* The `cols` argument of `tidy_kmeans()`, `tidy_pam()`, `tidy_hclust()`,
  `tidy_dbscan()`, `tidy_knn_dist()`, `tidy_dist()` and `tidy_pca()`
  takes tidy-select expressions, as documented. Only a character vector
  worked: `cols = c(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)` failed with `object
  'Sepal.Length' not found`, and `starts_with()` failed too.

* `tidy_knn_dist()`, `suggest_eps()`, `plot_knn_dist()`,
  `explore_dbscan_params()` and `tidy_dbscan()` accept a numeric matrix
  of coordinates. They failed with `no applicable method for 'select'`.

* `tidy_knn_dist()`, and through it `suggest_eps()` and
  `plot_knn_dist()`, refuse data with no numeric column, or with a
  missing value, in words that say so, as `tidy_dbscan()` does; dbscan
  stopped with `the provided data has 0 columns!` or `data/distances
  cannot contain NAs for kNN (with kd-tree)!`. `tidy_clara()` refuses
  data with no numeric column the same way, where `cluster::clara()`
  reported `Each of the random samples contains objects between which
  no distance can be computed`.

* **`standardize_data()` standardises a rowwise tibble over its whole
  columns.** `mutate()` works on a rowwise tibble one row at a time, and
  a single value has no spread, so every standardised value came back
  `NaN` (with `scale = FALSE`, every centred value was 0). The rowwise
  structure and its identifier columns are kept. A grouped tibble is
  still standardised within each group, which the documentation now
  says.

* `plot_clusters()` and `create_cluster_dashboard()` keep the cluster
  column off the default axes. As the first numeric column, an integer
  cluster column became the x axis. `create_cluster_dashboard()` now
  skips the scatter plot when the data has fewer than two numeric
  columns besides the cluster column. With fewer than two numeric
  columns counting the cluster column it failed with "`grobs` must be a
  single grob or a list of grobs"; with an integer cluster column and
  one other numeric column it plotted that column against the cluster
  labels. It leaves out the silhouette line when the metrics have none,
  where it warned about an unknown column and printed NA, and returns
  its plots as a named list (`clusters`, `sizes`, `metrics`).

* `plot_dendrogram()` draws a `tl_model(method = "hclust")` model. It
  passed the model to `plot()`, which reached `plot.tidylearn_model()`
  and failed with "unused arguments (main = ..., xlab = ...)". Another
  tidylearn model is refused by name.

* `plot_knn_dist()` labels a percentile that is not a whole percent:
  `percentile = 0.975` failed with `invalid format '%d'`, and so did
  0.57, since `0.57 * 100` is 56.99999999999999. It now reads "(97.5%
  percentile)".

* **`recommend_products()` suggests only items the basket lacks, each
  once, so its recommendations change.** Rules whose right-hand side was
  already in the basket were returned: for the basket `whole milk`,
  `other vegetables`, `yogurt`, `root vegetables`, `tropical fruit` on
  the `Groceries` rules at `support = 0.001`, `confidence = 0.5` it
  returned `{yogurt}` and then `{other vegetables}` four times, and now
  returns no rows, since every rule that fires suggests an item the
  basket holds. A product suggested by several rules is listed once,
  with its highest-lift rule. Rules are matched on their item lists, so
  an item name containing a comma, such as `"salt, iodised"`, can fire a
  rule; splitting the label on `","` cut it in two.

* **`filter_rules_by_item()` and `find_related_items()` match whole
  items, so they return fewer rules.** `grepl()` on the labels matched
  `"coffee"` inside `"instant coffee"`, returning 84 of the `Groceries`
  rules where 80 contain coffee, and `"ham"` inside `"hamburger meat"`,
  207 rules where 102 contain ham; 19 `Groceries` items occur inside
  other item names. `item` must be a single name: a vector was matched
  on its first element, with a warning.

* A frequent-itemsets result from `tidy_apriori()` prints and inspects
  as itemsets. `print()` read the rules table, which itemsets do not
  have: `tidy_apriori(Groceries, support = 0.05, target = "frequent
  itemsets")` printed nine min/max warnings and `Support: Inf - -Inf`,
  then failed with `no applicable method for 'slice'`, as
  `inspect_rules()` did. The result gains `itemsets_tbl` (`itemset_id`,
  `itemset`, `size`, the quality measures and an `items` list column),
  which `print()` and `inspect_rules()` read; `inspect_rules()` sorts
  itemsets by support by default, since they have no lift.

* `summarize_rules()` refuses an itemsets result with a message saying
  it holds itemsets; it returned `Inf`, `-Inf` and `NA` summaries with
  nine warnings. `recommend_products()`, `filter_rules_by_item()`,
  `find_related_items()` and `visualize_rules()` refuse it with the same
  message, where they failed with `no applicable method for 'filter'
  applied to an object of class "NULL"` or, for `visualize_rules()`, an
  arules method-dispatch error.

* **`visualize_rules()` plots the `top_n` rules with the highest lift,
  so it draws other rules.** It took the first `top_n` in mining order
  under the subtitle "Top 50 rules (colored by lift)": on the
  `Groceries` rules at `support = 0.001`, `confidence = 0.5` it plotted
  lifts 2.04 to 16.7, where the 50 highest run from 8.08 to 19.0. The
  subtitle now reads "Top 50 rules by lift". The other methods draw the
  same top-lift rules.

* **`inspect_rules(decreasing = FALSE)` returns the `n` lowest-ranked
  rules, lowest first, as arules' `head(by = )` does.** It took the `n`
  highest and only reversed their order: lifts 16.4, 16.7 and 19.0 for
  `by = "lift", n = 3` on the `Groceries` rules, where the three lowest
  are 1.96.

### Plots and tables

* `plot()` on a `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` or `"elastic_net"` model draws
  `type = "importance"` with `tl_plot_importance_regularized()`, where
  it said the plot was not implemented. `type = "residuals"` works for
  every regression method, and `type = "diagnostics"` is refused by name
  outside `"linear"`, `"polynomial"` and `"logistic"` (the models fitted
  by `lm()` or `glm()`), where it failed inside `rstandard()`. Residuals
  came from `fitted()`, which is `NULL` on a glmnet fit, so the plot was
  returned and failed when printed; they now come from the model's
  predictions, on the scale the formula fits. Residuals against
  predicted values also failed for a linear model whose data had a
  missing value, with `Can't recycle input of size 32 to size 31`.

* `plot()` with `type = "roc"`, `"precision_recall"`, `"calibration"` or
  `"confusion"` scores rows against the classes the model was trained
  on. The classes were read off the data, so a test split of
  `iris[iris$Species != "setosa", ]` still declaring setosa was refused
  as multiclass, and a test factor with its levels reordered switched
  the positive class of the precision-recall and calibration curves.
  Rows missing a response or a prediction are left out with a warning
  giving the count: ROC and precision-recall stopped with ROCR's
  `'predictions' contains NA`, and the confusion counts summed to 30 of
  32 with no message. ROC and precision-recall need rows of both classes
  and now say so, where ROCR reported `Number of classes is not equal
  to 2`.

* `plot(type = "actual_predicted")` compares on the scale the model was
  fitted on and leaves incomplete rows out of its statistics, with a
  warning giving the count. For `log(mpg) ~ wt` it plotted raw `mpg`
  against predictions of `log(mpg)` and reported a correlation of 0.868,
  where the fitted scale gives 0.893, and one missing value made the
  subtitle `Correlation: NA, R-squared: NA`.

* `tl_plot_intervals()` works with `y ~ .`, which failed with `argument
  1 is not a vector`, and plots the observed response on the scale of
  the bands: for `log(mpg) ~ wt` it drew raw `mpg` against bands for
  `log(mpg)`. A model without an `lm()` fit is refused by name, where
  `"ridge"` failed asking for `newx`. Data without the response gets the
  bands alone, and a row with a missing predictor is left out with one
  warning, where ggplot2 gave four.

* **Importance for `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` no longer
  depends on the units of each predictor, so its values change in
  `tl_table_importance()`, `tl_plot_importance_regularized()` and
  `tl_plot_importance_comparison()`.** It was the absolute coefficient,
  so rescaling `hp` to hundreds multiplied its importance about a
  hundredfold without changing a prediction. Each coefficient is now
  multiplied by the standard deviation of its design column over the
  rows the model was fitted on. A multiclass model, which failed with
  `non-numeric argument to mathematical function`, now takes each
  predictor's largest value across classes. A penalty that drops every
  predictor is reported as such, where it gave an empty table and a
  `max()` warning.

* **Importance for a random forest whose permutation importance is
  negative for every feature keeps randomForest's order.**
  `tl_table_importance()`, `plot(model, type = "importance")` and the
  importance comparison divided by the largest value, itself negative,
  so %IncMSE of -6.20, -0.87 and -6.61 (`set.seed(7)`, three noise
  predictors) became 709, 100 and 756 and the least useful feature
  ranked first. With no positive value the largest magnitude now sets
  the scale: -93.8, -13.2 and -100. Any set with a positive value is
  scaled as before.

* Variable importance works for more models. A forest fitted with
  `importance = FALSE` failed with `subscript out of bounds`; it now
  uses the impurity measure the forest does have.
  `tl_table_importance()`, which documented xgboost support, refused
  xgboost models; they now report gain. `plot(model, type =
  "importance")` shares the table's extraction, and the dashboard's
  importance panel, which
  showed an error for `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"`, now
  plots them. `tl_plot_importance_comparison()` with no supported model
  failed inside dplyr; it now says so.

* Importance for a tree with no splits stops with "No feature has
  non-zero importance: the tree has no splits", in
  `tl_table_importance()`, `plot(model, type = "importance")` and the
  dashboard's importance panel. They failed with
  ``Column `importance` not found in `.data` ``, and so did any
  `tl_plot_importance_comparison()` that included the tree, which now
  draws with that tree at zero.

* `tl_plot_importance_comparison()` counts as zero a feature a model was
  given but did not use. The ranking averaged each feature over only the
  models that kept it, so a feature a lasso dropped could outrank one
  both models used. A tree, forest or boost model is given the variables
  of an interaction, never the interaction itself, so `wt:hp` gets no
  bar from it.

* **Importance for `method = "boost"` names the columns gbm fitted on,
  so the rows it reports change.** gbm names its relative influence
  after the formula's terms but computes it over the variables they use,
  so for `mpg ~ wt * hp + qsec` `tl_table_importance()`,
  `plot(model, type = "importance")` and the importance comparison
  listed a `wt:hp` at zero, a column gbm never had, and for
  `mpg ~ wt:hp + qsec` they failed with gbm's "row names contain missing
  values". Both now report `wt`, `hp` and `qsec`, each with its own
  influence.

* `tl_plot_importance_comparison()` names a factor predictor once for
  every model. randomForest, rpart and gbm report the factor (`Species`)
  and glmnet and xgboost its design columns (`Speciesversicolor`,
  `Speciesvirginica`), so a forest and a lasso of `Sepal.Length ~ .` on
  iris (`set.seed(1)`) drew 9 bars over 6 features: the one predictor
  appeared three times, each with one model's bar. Design columns now
  map back to their formula term, which takes its largest column, and
  the same pair draws 8 bars over 4 features. A non-syntactic name was
  split the same way: rpart reports `car weight` and glmnet
  `` `car weight` ``, so a lasso and a tree showed two features; they
  now show one, named without backquotes. A lasso that penalised every
  predictor away dropped out of the plot with only a `max()` warning; it
  now stays at zero, with a warning naming it.

* `tl_plot_importance_comparison()` refuses repeated `names`.
  `names = c("A", "A")` drew both models' bars in the same places; it is
  now an error, as it already was for `tl_plot_model_comparison()` and
  `tl_table_comparison()`.

* An unrecognised `lambda` is now rejected by name. Anything that was
  not `"1se"` or `"min"` used to reach `glmnet::coef()` as a penalty, so
  a typo such as `"1SE"` failed with `non-numeric argument to binary
  operator` and a vector of penalties with `the condition has length >
  1`, neither of which names the argument at fault. A numeric `lambda`
  outside the penalties the model was fitted over is refused as well.
  glmnet returns the coefficients at the nearest end of the path for it,
  which the table labelled with the penalty asked for: `lambda = 0`
  returned the coefficients at the smallest penalty on the path,
  labelled as unpenalised. The same penalty checks apply to regularised
  importance. `tl_coefficients()` takes no `...`, so a misspelt argument
  such as broom's `conf.int = TRUE` is an error rather than a table
  without an interval.

* `tl_coefficients()` and `tl_table_coefficients()` report a term the
  fit could not estimate — one of two collinear predictors, or an
  interaction of factors with a combination no row has — as a row with
  an `NA` estimate. `summary()` drops aliased terms from its coefficient
  matrix, so `tl_table_coefficients()` omitted them silently:
  `mpg ~ wt + wt_doubled` produced a two-row table for a three-term
  formula, with nothing to show the third term had ever been there. A
  fit of full rank is unaffected.

* `tl_plot_model_comparison()` and `tl_table_comparison()` keep two
  models of the same method apart. Both got the same default name
  (`"linear (reg)"` in the table), so the plot drew one bar over the
  other and the table pivoted the pair into list cells. Repeated default
  names are now numbered, and `tl_table_comparison()` checks `names` has
  one unique entry per model, as the plot already checked its length.

* `tl_table_comparison()` and `tl_plot_model_comparison()` with no
  `new_data` score the models on their training data only when every
  model was fitted on the same data. Both scored every model on the
  first model's training rows: two linear models fitted on
  `mtcars[1:20, ]` and `mtcars[13:32, ]` were compared on the first
  one's rows, which the second had partly never seen, without a message.
  Models fitted on different data are now an error naming them and
  asking for `new_data`. Models fitted on one data frame with different
  formulas still share it. A `tl_auto_ml()` PCA or cluster candidate
  stores its engineered features in place of the rows it was fitted on,
  so with a PCA candidate listed first the first model's stored data was
  the PCA scores, and the comparison failed inside the candidate with
  "PCA was fitted on 4 column(s) ... but new_data is missing". Every
  model is now scored on the raw training rows of the first model that
  stores them, a cluster candidate included, and a PCA candidate through
  its own projection, as it already was when listed after one. Models
  fitted on PCA scores alone store no raw rows, and still need
  `new_data`.

* **`tl_plot_lift()` and `tl_plot_gain()` no longer depend on row order,
  so their curves change.** Rows with tied probabilities kept the order
  they arrived in, and a tree scores many rows alike: for a tree of
  `Species ~ Sepal.Width` on two iris classes, reversing the rows moved
  the gain at 10% of the population from 0% to 20% of responders. Each
  row now counts the response rate of its tie group, the value any
  tie-breaking gives on average. A row missing its response turned every
  point to `NA` and left the chart empty; those rows are now left out,
  with a warning. The bins also match `bins`: sizing them by rounding up
  gave 32 rows in 10 bins as 8, and a `bins` that is not a whole number
  of at least 1 is refused.

* **`tl_plot_lift()`, `tl_plot_gain()` and `tl_table_confusion()` read
  the observed classes against the model's.** The positive class came
  from the scored data's level order, so reordering `am`'s levels to
  `c("1", "0")` made the gain chart of `am ~ wt` rank mtcars by P(am =
  0) and count the 19 automatic cars as responders, where the model's
  positive class is the 13 manual ones. Lift and gain decide binary from
  the model: a test split of `iris[iris$Species != "setosa", ]` still
  declares setosa, so both charts called a binary model multiclass and
  refused it; they now draw it. The confusion matrix of a two-class
  model gained a row of zeros for a class the scored data declared but
  did not hold, and a row for each class the model was never trained on.
  It now has one row and one column per class the model was trained on.
  Rows of any other class are left out with a warning, where lift and
  gain failed. Lift and gain on scored rows with no row of the positive
  class are an error naming the class, where every cumulative value was
  0 / 0. A `new_data` without the response column is reported by name
  ("Response variable 'am' not found in the evaluation data") where the
  charts said the model was not binary and the confusion table failed
  with "all arguments must have the same length".

* `tl_table_confusion()` warns when rows are missing a response or a
  prediction. `table()` dropped them, and the counts summed to fewer
  rows than were passed in without saying so.

* `tl_dashboard()`'s regression panels work for every method. The
  Residuals panel passed the evaluation data to `tl_plot_residuals()` as
  its plot type and failed with "the condition has length > 1" for
  linear, lasso and forest models; it now plots residuals of the
  dashboard's data against predictions. The Diagnostics panel printed
  the four diagnostic plots in turn and showed only the last, Residuals
  vs Leverage; it now arranges all four (with gridExtra installed). For
  a model that is not linear or polynomial it failed inside
  `rstandard()`, and now says the plots need a linear or polynomial
  model. The Predictions table and the Residuals panel read the response
  as the formula's left-hand side: a `log(mpg) ~ wt + hp` model listed
  mpg beside log-scale predictions, with residuals of one minus the
  other.

* `tl_plot_cv_results(metrics = )` draws only the metrics asked for. The
  mean lines were not filtered, so `metrics = "rmse"` still laid out a
  panel for every metric the folds scored, with fold lines in rmse
  alone. A requested metric the folds did not score is named in a
  warning, and asking only for absent metrics is an error listing the
  ones available.

* The source notes of the `tl_table*()` tables count the rows the table
  describes. Every note reported `nrow(model$data)`: coefficients for
  `Ozone ~ Temp + Wind` on airquality said n = 153 where `lm()` used
  116, and metrics and confusion tables scored on a 10-row test set said
  n = 22, the training rows. Coefficient and importance tables now count
  the rows the fit used, and metrics, confusion and comparison tables
  the rows scored; a comparison whose models scored different rows gives
  each model's count. An xgboost fit with `weights` counts only the rows
  with a weight, which are the rows xgboost trains on.

* `tl_table_clusters()` summarises only the columns an hclust or dbscan
  fit used. A dbscan model of `~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width` on
  `iris[, 1:4]` tabulated the means of all four measurements, while the
  kmeans table already showed only the fitted two. The cluster table no
  longer counts dbscan's noise points as a cluster, and now averages
  hclust and dbscan tables around missing values. A long formula no
  longer splits a table's source note in two, and
  `tl_table_coefficients()` warns about arguments it does not use.

* `tl_plot_regularization_path()` draws a multiclass model, one panel
  per class; it failed with `Tibble columns must have compatible sizes`.
  Its feature labels were drawn on top of the paths they name, in the
  same colour, so they were unreadable, and two coefficients that end
  close together printed one label over the other. On `mtcars` that hid
  `drat` behind `qsec` and clipped `am` and `wt` at the panel edge.
  Labels now sit clear of the leftmost point, spread far enough apart to
  read, each with a leader line back to its own path. The room for
  labels grows with the longest name, so `Speciesversicolor` is no
  longer cut off at the panel edge at 7 x 5 inches. When every path is
  labelled -- five or
  fewer predictors at the default `label_n` -- they were all drawn grey,
  thin and faint, because the colour, width and transparency scales
  matched their values by position; they are now drawn in the accent
  colour.

* `tl_plot_regularization_path()` refuses a model fitted at a single
  `lambda`. Each term was one point, so the plot drew no line, under a
  subtitle naming a `lambda.min` and `lambda.1se` no cross-validation
  had chosen. A model fitted along several penalties without
  cross-validation, as earlier versions fitted a `lambda` sequence, is
  drawn without the `lambda.min` and `lambda.1se` lines and says so.

* `tl_plot_regularization_cv()` labels its axis with the measure
  cross-validation used. It read "Binomial Deviance" for every
  classifier, a multinomial one included, and "Mean Squared Error" for
  every regression, whatever `type.measure` chose.

* `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()` draws the tree `tree_index` names. On xgboost
  3.x it drew the first tree whatever `tree_index` was, and warned that
  `tree_index` will become an error. A `tree_index` past the model's
  last tree is refused with the number of trees.

* **`tl_xgboost_shap()` reports a multiclass model's SHAP values per
  class: one block of rows per class, with a `class` column.** It
  labelled a flattened slice of xgboost 3.x's row x class x feature
  array, so on `iris` the column called `Petal.Length` held
  `Sepal.Length`'s values for virginica, and 11 of the 18 columns were
  named `NA`, `NA.1` and so on. It also scores data without the response
  column, which failed with `object 'mpg' not found`, and applies
  `trees_idx` as a run of boosting rounds, where it was dropped.

* `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_dependence()` takes its SHAP values and its
  feature values from the same rows. It drew two independent samples, so
  for `y = 10x` over 400 rows the plotted correlation between the
  feature and its SHAP value was near zero. Both SHAP plots draw a
  multiclass model one panel per class.

* `tl_plot_svm_boundary()` takes its default axes from the model's
  numeric predictors, and fills in only an axis that was not named. They
  were the first two numeric columns of the data, so
  `Species ~ Petal.Length + Petal.Width` was drawn over the sepal
  columns the model never used. The 0.5 probability contour of a
  two-class model is drawn; a check against the wrong fields of the
  e1071 fit kept it from ever appearing.

* `tl_plot_partial_dependence()` draws the mean prediction at each grid
  value for a regression model. It took `mean()` of the tibble
  `predict()` returns, so every regression curve, the function's own
  example included, was `NA`, with a warning for each grid value.

* `tl_plot_deep_architecture()` draws through the `plot()` method keras
  provides for its models. It called `keras::plot_model()`, which keras
  2.x does not have, so every call failed with `object 'plot_model' not
  found`.

### Data ingestion

* `tl_read()` names the cause for sources it cannot read. A web URL
  other than GitHub or Kaggle was passed to the CSV reader and reported
  as "File not found"; it is refused with a message to download the file
  first, with or without `format`. Hosts are matched on the URL's host
  name, so `https://mirror.example.org/github.com/data.csv` is no longer
  taken for GitHub. `s3://bucket/archive.zip` was looked for as a local
  zip file, and `tl_read_s3()` and `tl_read_github()` now say they
  cannot read zip archives. An `NA` or empty `source` is refused by
  name; it failed with "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". URL
  schemes match in any case, so `S3://` reaches the S3 reader.

* `tl_read_dir()` reads files only. Without `recursive = TRUE`,
  `list.files()` also returns folders, so a folder whose name matched,
  such as `old.csv`, was read as a directory and its rows were added to
  the result.

* **`tl_read_zip(file = )` reads the member it was asked for.**
  `file = "train.csv"` read `full_train.csv` when the archive held both,
  because the name was matched as part of each member's base name and
  the first match in file order won, with no message under
  `.quiet = TRUE`. An exact path within the archive now wins, then an
  exact file name, then part of a path, and a name that matches several
  members at the deciding step is an error listing them. A member in a
  folder can be named by its path, such as `"2024/sales.csv"`; of two
  members called `sales.csv`, only the first could be read before.

* `tl_read_zip()` and `tl_read_kaggle()` refuse an archive with a member
  whose name is an absolute path such as `/x.csv`, has a `..` component,
  or, on Windows, names a drive (`C:x.csv`). Before R 4.5.1, which
  tidylearn supports, `unzip()` extracts such members as written, so a
  crafted archive could plant a file anywhere the user can write, such
  as an `.Rprofile` that runs at the next R start. From R 4.5.1
  `unzip()` drops the `..` components instead, so on those versions
  such an archive used to be read. Every `..` component is refused,
  including one that stays inside, such as `a/../b.csv`.

* `tl_read_github()` reads file links from `www.github.com`, links
  carrying a query such as `?raw=true`, and links using `/raw/` in place
  of `/blob/`. The raw-file address was built by substituting text:
  `?raw=true` hid the file extension, `www.github.com` was taken for
  "owner/repo" shorthand, and in a repository owned by an account called
  `blob` the owner's name was removed in place of the `/blob/` segment.
  A link to something other than a file, such as a `/tree/` folder, is
  refused by name, and a `raw.githubusercontent.com` link keeps its
  query, where a private file's token lives.

* `tl_read_kaggle()` reads the dataset a Kaggle URL names, whichever tab
  it was copied from. The slug was the URL's last two path segments, so
  `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris/data` downloaded the
  dataset `iris/data`, another owner's, which passed validation; `/code`
  and `/versions/2` did the same, and a trailing slash or a `?select=`
  query was refused with a message about something else. A competition
  URL is read as a competition without `type = "competition"`, and
  contradicting it with `type` is an error. `type` itself is checked: a
  misspelt value was treated as `"dataset"`.

* `tl_read_kaggle(dest = )` downloads into a directory of its own and
  copies the download into `dest`. It downloaded into `dest` and
  unpacked every zip there, so an unrelated archive in the folder
  overwrote the user's files, and a later call could return an earlier
  download's files, re-extracted and so the newest, in place of the
  dataset asked for. Files from this download still replace files of the
  same name in `dest`; nothing else there is read, unpacked or changed.

* `tl_read_postgres()` connects with a `postgres://` connection string.
  It passed the string to RPostgres as `dsn`, which libpq has no keyword
  for, so every connection string failed with 'invalid connection option
  "dsn"'. The URL is taken apart into host, port, user, password and
  database name; query parameters such as `sslmode=require` go to libpq
  as connection keywords; and the named arguments fill parts the URL
  leaves out, which keeps a password out of it. `tl_read_mysql()` uses
  its `dbname`, `user`, `password` and `port` arguments for the parts a
  `mysql://` URL leaves out. With a URL they were ignored, so
  `port = 3307` alongside `"mysql://host/db"` connected to 3306.

* Database connection strings are percent-decoded, so a password written
  `p%40ss` reaches the server as `p@ss`; it was sent encoded.
  `tl_read_mysql()` refuses query parameters: `?ssl-mode=REQUIRED`
  became part of the database name, and RMariaDB ignores arguments it
  does not know, so passing it on would connect without the TLS asked
  for. Pass `RMariaDB::dbConnect()` arguments such as `ssl.ca` through
  `...` instead. The progress message from `tl_read()` and the
  `tl_source` attribute redact a password given as `?password=`, as a
  libpq keyword, after an empty user name (`postgres://:secret@host`) or
  under an upper-case scheme, all of which were shown in the clear. The
  same goes for the SSL key passphrase (`?sslpassword=`), for the other
  secret-bearing keywords newer libpq versions take
  (`oauth_client_secret`, `scram_client_key`, `scram_server_key`), and
  for a password written in quotes (`password='two words'`) or with
  spaces around `=`. A local path is left alone: the redaction took
  `C:\Users\ana@corp\data.csv` for `user:password@host` and printed
  `C:***@corp\data.csv`. The "File not found" error redacts the path it
  names, which printed a connection string's password in full.

* `tl_read()` refuses a URL whose scheme it has no reader for, such as
  `ftp://`, with a message naming the scheme and listing the sources it
  reads; it reported `File not found`. A `file://` URL is read as the
  local path it names, percent-decoded, where it was reported as not
  found, and a `file://` URL naming another machine is refused. A source
  with a scheme can no longer be sent to a file reader with `format`:
  `tl_read("postgres://ana:secret@host/db", format = "csv")` failed with
  "File not found" and printed the password.
  `bigquery://project/dataset` sources are detected and read with
  `tl_read_bigquery()`, where they stopped with "Cannot detect format".

* `tl_read_bigquery()`, `tl_read_postgres()` and `tl_read_mysql()` check
  `project`, `dsn` and `query` before contacting a server, and the
  message names the argument. A `NULL` `project` or `dsn` failed with
  "argument is of length zero", and an `NA` `dsn` or `query` was handed
  to the database driver. `tl_read_bigquery()` also refuses a
  `bigquery://` URI with an empty project or dataset, such as
  `bigquery:///my_dataset`.

* `tl_read_bigquery(dataset = )` reaches the query as its default
  dataset, so unqualified table names resolve against it, as documented.
  It only labelled the result.

### Compute and cloud

* `tl_compute_advisor()`, and with it `tl_model(compute = "auto")`,
  handle problems past 2^31 - 1 cells. Rows times predictors was an
  integer product, so 1e7 rows by 250 predictors overflowed to `NA` and
  both failed with "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed", on the
  inputs the advisor exists to size.

* **`tl_compute_advisor()` counts predictors from the terms the formula
  expands to against the data, so its estimates change.** It counted the
  variable names on the right-hand side, so on a frame of 200 predictors
  plus `id` and `y`, `y ~ . - id` was sized as 2 predictors and `y ~ 1`
  as 201. A fitted model is sized from its own formula the same way.

* **`tl_compute_advisor()` sizes the fit tidylearn would run, so its
  estimates change.** A runtime hyperparameter left out takes the
  default of the method's fit function. It assumed 10 epochs of 128
  units for `"deep"`, where `tl_fit_deep()` trains 30 epochs through
  layers of 32 and 16, and a hidden layer of 10 for `"nn"` against
  `tl_fit_nn()`'s 5, which halves the `"nn"` estimate. On iris's four
  predictors the `"deep"` estimate is 3.8 times the old one. `"deep"`
  reads `hidden_layers`; `units`, which the help page listed, is no
  tidylearn argument and is ignored. A hyperparameter the estimate reads
  must be a positive number: `nrounds = NA` failed with "attempt to
  select less than one element", and a negative value gave a negative
  runtime.

* `print()` on a `tl_compute_advisor()` result, and its reasoning and
  notes, write large numbers out in full with thousands separators. A
  round value printed in scientific notation: a 100,000 MB peak read
  "1e+05".

* `tl_cloud_allow_host()` drops the trailing dot of a fully qualified
  name. `"fits.example.com."` was stored with the dot, which no
  endpoint's host carries, so the addition matched nothing.

## Documentation

* `?tl_model` lists the arguments tidylearn takes for each method --
  among them `degree` for `"polynomial"`, `alpha`, `lambda` and
  `cv_folds` for the regularised methods, which were documented only on
  internal pages, and `mds_method` and `k` (or `ndim`) for choosing an
  MDS variant and its dimensions -- names `"polynomial"` among the
  methods, and says that a logical response is a regression for every
  method but `"logistic"`.

* The reporting vignette said every plot function returns a ggplot2
  object. `plot_dendrogram()`, which `plot()` uses for an hclust model,
  `tl_plot_tree()` and `tl_plot_nn_architecture()` draw with base
  graphics, `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()` returns a DiagrammeR widget, and
  the dashboards and `plot(type = "diagnostics")` return a grid or a
  list of plots; the vignette now lists the exceptions. It also said its
  reporting code runs unchanged with `method = "svm"`, for which
  `tl_table_importance()` errors. The README claimed ggplot2 output
  regardless of model type and labelled `plot(linear_model)` as
  diagnostic plots, where it draws actual against predicted values. The
  same "tibble or ggplot2 object" claim, in the README's Philosophy
  section and the getting-started vignette, now covers predictions,
  metrics and most plots, and getting-started counts 20 methods from 13
  packages where it said 20 packages.

* The supervised-learning vignette counted eleven supervised methods
  where there are thirteen, and said regularised regression and SVM need
  pre-scaled inputs. glmnet and e1071 standardise internally by default,
  so scaling beforehand leaves their predictions unchanged. The advice
  now covers `"nn"` alone.

* The unsupervised-learning vignette called "Cluster 1" the clean
  k-means cluster, but k-means numbers clusters arbitrarily and the
  vignette set no seed, so *setosa* came out as cluster 1, 2 or 3
  depending on the random state. The vignette now sets a seed and names
  the *setosa* cluster. It also said single linkage puts almost
  everything in one cluster, beside output showing 98 of 150 rows; it
  now gives that count.

* The AutoML vignette said a 30-second budget at the default five folds
  skips cross-validation entirely; on iris every model in that run is
  cross-validated. Its time-budget section now lists the gates the code
  applies: the forest and the advanced models need `time_budget >= 30`,
  the PCA and cluster phases start only while more than 5 seconds and
  10% of the budget remain, the advanced phase only while more than 40%
  remains, and a model is cross-validated only while more than 30%
  remains. The `glm.fit` convergence warnings it hides, counted as a
  dozen, came to six to eight in four runs and are now described as
  several. The vignette now sets a seed, so its folds and leaderboards
  repeat between builds.

* `?tl_auto_ml` describes the time budget as the code applies it. It
  said a budget under 30 seconds skips cross-validation and fits two
  models; its own example, `time_budget = 10` on iris, fits one tree and
  cross-validates it. `?tl_get_best_model` says the returned model
  expects preprocessed data and is meant to be used through
  `tl_predict_pipeline()`; `predict()` on it with raw rows returns wrong
  values without a warning. The help page for `tl_reduce_dimensions()`
  had the title "Integration Functions: Combining Supervised and
  Unsupervised Learning"; it now has its own.

* The help pages of the twelve readers of local files -- `tl_read()`,
  `tl_read_dir()`, `tl_read_zip()`, `tl_read_csv()`, `tl_read_tsv()`,
  `tl_read_excel()`, `tl_read_rds()`, `tl_read_rdata()`,
  `tl_read_parquet()`, `tl_read_json()`, `tl_read_db()` and
  `tl_read_sqlite()` -- have examples that run, on temporary files or on
  the sample files readr and readxl ship, each guarded on the suggested
  package it needs. Every line of their examples was commented out. The
  six readers that need a server, credentials or the network have their
  examples as code in `\dontrun{}`. The `tl_compute_advisor()` example
  fits xgboost on two threads.

* The `@return` sections of `tidy_pam()`, `tidy_dbscan()`,
  `tidy_apriori()`, `tidy_kmeans()` and `tidy_hclust()` name the
  elements the functions return. They listed `silhouette` (the elements
  are `silhouette_avg` and `silhouette_data`), `core_points` (the flags
  are `clusters$is_core`) and the class `"tidy_rules"` (it is
  `"tidy_apriori"`), and left out `tidy_kmeans()`'s `sizes`,
  `tidy_hclust()`'s `distance_method`, and `tidy_dbscan()`'s `summary`,
  `eps` and `minPts`.

* `visualize_rules()`'s `@return` said only `method = "scatter"` returns
  a ggplot and that other methods draw as a side effect. arulesViz
  returns ggplot objects for `"graph"`, `"grouped"` and `"matrix"` too;
  only `"paracoord"`, which draws with grid, returns a grid `vpPath`.
  Its `rules_obj` documentation no longer lists a table of rules, which
  the function refuses.

* `inst/examples/unified_workflow.R` printed "Transfer learning model
  built on  over 3 principal components": it read `$spec$method`, which
  a `tl_transfer_learning()` result does not have. It also printed
  "Original data: 5 features with missing values" when one of the five
  had any. The lines now read "Transfer learning model: forest fitted on
  3 principal components" and "Original data: 5 features, 1 with missing
  values", and the processed-data line counts its missing values the
  same way. `tests/testthat/test-examples.R` checks all three.

* `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s four links into the README were 404s on
  the documentation site. pkgdown rewrote `README.md#...` to
  `README.html`, a page it never builds, because it publishes the README
  as the site's home page. They now point at the home page's sections
  directly, which also works when the file is read on GitHub.

* The hex logo has sharp corners, in line with other R package hex
  stickers. The artwork is otherwise unchanged.

# tidylearn 0.5.0

## New Features

### Cloud compute (security guards)

* `tl_cloud_consent()` — grants or revokes permission for the rest of the
  R session to upload training data to your Modal account. Cloud fits
  otherwise require `confirm_upload = TRUE` on every call. The lock is
  never written to disk and does not survive an R restart, and tidylearn
  never prompts interactively, so scripts and CI behave the same as an
  interactive session.

* Cloud endpoints are read from the `TIDYLEARN_MODAL_ENDPOINT`
  environment variable and validated before any request is built: the
  scheme must be `https` and the host must be on the allowlist.
  Lookalikes such as `modal.run.example.com` or `evil-modal.run` are
  rejected. The endpoint is user-supplied configuration, so this check is
  what stops a typo or a modified variable sending training data
  somewhere other than Modal. An environment variable is used rather than
  an R option because an option can be set silently by a shared
  `.Rprofile`.

* `tl_cloud_allow_host()` and `tl_cloud_allowed_hosts()` — the allowlist
  defaults to Modal's own domains, and Modal customers serving Web
  Functions from a custom domain can extend it. Extension is a
  per-session call rather than an option or environment variable, for the
  same reason: nothing inherited from the environment should be able to
  add an upload destination. Added hosts must be bare host names, and a
  single label such as `"com"` is refused because it would open an entire
  top-level domain.

  These implement T2 and T9 of
  `system.file("security/threat-model.md", package = "tidylearn")`.
  Submission itself is still not wired up — `compute = "cloud"` continues
  to error.

### Cloud compute (model serialisation)

* Internal helpers now convert a fitted model to bytes and back for
  transport from a remote worker. Twelve of the thirteen supervised
  methods survive base R serialisation unchanged, xgboost included — its
  booster is embedded in the byte stream rather than left as a dangling
  pointer.

  `method = "deep"` is the exception and is handled separately: a keras
  model is a reference to a Python object and cannot cross a process
  boundary that way, so its weights travel as their own hdf5 payload via
  `keras::serialize_model()`. Detection is by the presence of a Python
  object rather than by method name or keras class, because keras renamed
  its classes between versions and matching those would silently stop
  detecting models on one side of the change.

## Bug Fixes

Several of these changed reported numbers. Results produced by 0.4.0 and
earlier should be recomputed.

### Degenerate inputs

* `tl_model(method = "forest")` hung indefinitely on a classification
  response whose predictors were all constant. randomForest's
  classification path keeps drawing `mtry` candidates looking for a split
  that cannot exist, and the loop is C-level, so it ignored interrupts and
  the session had to be killed. It was reachable through `tl_pipeline()`,
  whose default candidates include a forest, and through `tl_auto_ml()`,
  whose baselines do. Now refused before the call, naming the columns.
  Regression is unaffected and still fits, as does a frame where only some
  predictors are constant. The predictor set is read through `terms()`, so
  a `.` is expanded against the data and an exclusion such as `y ~ . - id`
  is honoured.

* A character specification such as `"Species ~ ."` was read as a
  regression problem by every entry point except `tl_model()`.
  `tl_model_supervised()` coerces with `as.formula()`, but that happens
  after `tl_pipeline()`, `tl_prepare_data()`, `tl_cv()`, `tl_auto_ml()`
  and the two tuners have already called `all.vars(formula)[1]` -- and
  `all.vars()` on a string is `character(0)`, so the response name came
  back `NA` and `data[[NA]]` was `NULL`. `tl_auto_ml(iris, "Species ~ .")`
  announced "task: regression" and returned an unranked leaderboard;
  `tl_pipeline()` scored a classification tree with `rmse` and returned a
  pipeline whose every metric was `NA`, warning only that the values were
  missing. Coercion now happens at each entry point, before anything reads
  the formula, and an argument that is neither a formula nor a string that
  parses as one is refused by name.

* A repeated name in `tl_pipeline(models = ...)` silently discarded a
  model. The training loop indexes `models[[model_name]]`, which resolves
  to the first match, so `list(a = tree, a = forest)` fitted the tree
  twice and never fitted the forest. Repeated names are now refused, next
  to the existing guard for unnamed ones.

* Malformed entries in `models` reported base R internals that named
  neither the model nor the mistake: a spec with no `method` gave "missing
  value where TRUE/FALSE needed", a spec that was not a list gave "$
  operator is invalid for atomic vectors", a two-element `method` gave
  "'length = 2' in coercion to 'logical(1)'", and an unsupervised method
  gave "undefined columns selected". Each is now checked before the run
  starts and names the offending model.

* `evaluation$cv_folds` and `evaluation$train_prop` were unvalidated.
  `train_prop = 0` reached base R as "result would be too long a vector",
  `train_prop = 1` surfaced as a ROCR complaint about class counts, and
  `train_prop = 1.5` as "cannot take a sample larger than the
  population"; bad fold counts arrived as rsample errors naming `v`, which
  is not an argument of anything the caller wrote. Both are now checked
  against their own names, and both are checked again against the row
  count when the pipeline runs: more folds than rows is reported as such,
  and so is a `train_prop` that is in range but rounds to an empty side on
  a small frame. `evaluation$validation` and `evaluation$best_metric` were
  in the same position one step earlier -- set to `NULL` they were dropped
  from the list and reached `%in%` as "argument is of length zero" -- and
  are now reported by name too.

* An unrecognised name in `evaluation$metrics` was accepted, computed
  nothing, and left the run warning that all values were `NA` -- the
  symptom rather than the cause. Unknown metrics are now refused with the
  list of available ones, matching what `tl_tune_grid()` already did. An
  empty metric set is refused too; it previously rendered the
  `best_metric` error as a bare full stop. The list is judged against the
  task the pipeline will actually fit, `tl_model()`'s logistic rule
  included: `method = "logistic"` on a 0/1 integer response fits a
  classification model and each fold reports classification metrics, so
  `accuracy` and `auc` are accepted there.

* A numeric response with both logistic and any other supervised method
  among the candidates gave one run two tasks. The leaderboard holds one
  set of metrics, so whichever way they were chosen the other models
  scored `NA` and dropped out of the comparison silently -- `logistic`
  plus `linear` on a 0/1 column ranked logistic at 0.6998 and reported
  nothing at all for linear. The mixture is now refused where the models
  are read, naming the methods on each side. A factor response is
  unaffected: there is one task there, and mixing methods is the ordinary
  case.

* A response that is not a column of `data` -- a typo in the formula --
  read as `NULL` in `tl_pipeline()`, which set regression defaults and
  failed several steps later inside rpart with "object 'Speces' not
  found". It is now refused where the formula is read, listing the columns
  that are there.

* An intercept-only formula (`y ~ 1`) reached `tl_run_pipeline()` and
  failed with "result would be too long a vector". A pipeline preprocesses
  and scores predictors, so it now says it needs at least one.

* A single-class response was named plainly only by logistic regression.
  Every other classification method reported whatever its backend hit
  first: rpart "number of rows of matrices must match (see arg 2)", glmnet
  "non-conformable arguments", e1071 "Model is empty!", xgboost a
  complaint about `num_class`. Ten of the thirteen supervised methods now
  give the same message, naming the response and the class it holds.
  `linear` and `polynomial` keep the numeric-response message they already
  had, which now says the response holds a single class rather than
  offering classification methods that would refuse it in turn, and
  logistic regression keeps its own wording.

* `method = "forest"` and `method = "svm"` derived their defaults from
  the number of columns in the frame rather than the number of predictors
  in the formula, so an explicit formula over a wider frame got the wrong
  one. `mpg ~ wt + hp` on `mtcars` asked randomForest for `mtry = 3` of 2
  predictors, which it reset with a warning, and asked e1071 for a kernel
  width of 1/10 instead of 1/2, with nothing said at all.
  `Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width` on `iris` asked for `mtry = 2` of
  2, also in silence -- every predictor sampled at every split, which is
  bagging rather than a random forest. Neither default is computed now:
  where the caller and the tuner leave the argument unset, it is left
  unset, and the wrapped package applies the same default it documents.
  A `y ~ .` formula is unaffected, which is why this survived. The 0.3.0
  entry below took the response column out of the SVM count; what
  remained was every other column in the frame. Leaving an argument out
  takes `do.call()`, which evaluates before it builds the call, so the
  `match.call()` these backends run recorded the training frame as a
  literal: `print(model$fit)` spilled every row, and on a 960-row frame
  the stored call alone was 159 Kb of a 1.5 Mb forest. The `data`
  argument is put back to a symbol after the fit.

* The `$fit` slot was documented as the wrapped object throughout. That
  holds for a supervised method; an unsupervised one returns tidied
  components as well, so its `$fit` is the list holding them and the
  wrapped object is at `$fit$model`. Corrected in `tl_model()`, the
  `Description` field, the README, the architecture notes, and the
  getting-started, unsupervised and integration vignettes.

* `tl_read_s3()` raised "subscript out of bounds" for a zero-length or
  multi-element `source`, the one malformed input that missed its own
  "Invalid S3 URI" message.

### Metrics and evaluation

* `tl_cv()` explains a metric that no fold could compute rather than
  leaving a bare `NaN` in the summary. `folds = nrow(data)` is
  leave-one-out, so every test fold holds one observation and `rsq` —
  which needs variation in the truth — is undefined; `mean()` over nothing
  then reported `NaN`, which reads as a malfunction rather than as a
  property of the request. `rmse` and `mae` are defined for a single
  observation and are unaffected.

* `tl_cv()` no longer repeats `tl_model()`'s notes once per fold. The note
  that a numeric response with few distinct values is being treated as
  regression is about the data, not the fold, and appeared k times.

* `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` computed precision, recall,
  sensitivity, specificity and F1 for the **wrong class**. The
  `yardstick` calls omitted `event_level`, so they defaulted to the first
  factor level while the rest of the package — AUC, class prediction,
  lift and gain — treats the second level as positive. A binary model
  predicting only positives reported specificity 1.0 where the true value
  is 0.0. Threshold metrics from `tl_evaluate_thresholds()` were affected
  the same way, so reported precision fell as the threshold rose.
  Multiclass metrics were never affected.

* `tl_cv()` never evaluated the last `n %% folds` observations: folds
  were sized with `floor(n / folds)` and sliced forward, leaving the
  remainder in every training set and no test set. On `mtcars` with
  `folds = 5`, 30 of 32 rows were scored. Rows are now assigned to folds
  so that the folds partition the data and differ in size by at most one.
  `tl_cv()` also rejects fold counts below 2 or above `nrow(data)`.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` tested linearity with
  `cor(fitted, residuals)`, which is identically zero for any OLS fit
  with an intercept — the check could only ever report SATISFIED. It is
  now a RESET-style test on powers of the fitted values.

### Fitting

* `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` no longer fail when a predictor
  has a missing value. The response was read from `data` while the design
  matrix came from `model.frame()`, which applies `na.omit` — so a single
  missing predictor left `y` one row longer than `x`, and glmnet reported
  "number of observations in y (60) not equal to the number of rows of x
  (59)". That names neither missing values nor the column responsible, and
  reads as though the caller had passed mismatched inputs. The response is
  now taken from the same model frame that builds the design matrix, so
  these methods drop the incomplete row and carry on, as `lm()`,
  `rpart()`, `nnet()` and `svm()` already did.

### Prediction

* Classification now reduces the response to the classes it contains. A
  subset keeps every factor level, so `iris[iris$Species != "setosa", ]`
  holds two classes and declares three, and that frame broke seven of the
  eight classification methods in seven different ways: `randomForest` and
  `glmnet` refused to fit, `gbm` and `nnet` failed at `predict()` or
  `tl_evaluate()`, and `rpart` returned a probability column for the class
  that was not there. Worst of the set, `tl_calc_classification_metrics()`
  read the declared level count when deciding whether the problem was
  binary, so it stopped passing `event_level` and let `yardstick` score the
  first class as positive — silently reopening, for any such response, the
  metric defect fixed above.

  The fitted models were never wrong: `glm()` and the rest drop an empty
  level internally, so the coefficients always matched the explicitly
  dropped frame. Only tidylearn's description of them was wrong. The
  response is normalised once in `tl_model()`, so the specification, the
  fit and every predict path now agree, and metrics from a subset match
  those from `droplevels()` exactly.

* `tl_model(method = "logistic")` records a classification model when the
  response is stored as something other than a factor. A 0/1 integer
  response produced a binomial `glm()` described by a specification that
  said `is_classification = FALSE`, so `tl_evaluate()` scored it with
  `rmse`, `mae` and `rsq` — and asking it for `accuracy` returned an empty
  tibble, with no error and no warning.

* `predict()` failed or returned wrong output for six method-and-task
  combinations, all now fixed and covered by a contract test that runs
  every method through the same grid:

  * Multiclass `"boost"` returned a **single** prediction for the whole
    input, because `predict.gbm` hands back a 3-D array that
    `is.matrix()` does not recognise. `type = "prob"` errored for any
    input with more than one row.
  * `"svm"` with `type = "prob"` always errored: the fitted object
    records the flag as `$compprob`, not `$probability`.
  * Binary classification with `method = "nn"` could not fit at all —
    `entropy` was passed explicitly and collided with the value
    `nnet.formula()` supplies itself.
  * `"xgboost"` built its design matrix from the full two-sided formula,
    so scoring data without the response column was impossible.
  * `"svm"` and `"xgboost"` silently dropped rows with missing
    predictors, returning a shorter vector so that predictions no longer
    lined up with the input rows.
  * Multinomial `"ridge"`/`"lasso"`/`"elastic_net"` with `type = "prob"`
    errored on single-row input.

  The `nn` failure is worth its own note: `nnet.formula()` supplies
  `entropy = TRUE` itself when the response is a two-level factor, and
  `tl_fit_nn()` named it again, so `nnet.default()` received it twice and
  reported "formal argument 'entropy' matched by multiple actual
  arguments". Three or more classes were unaffected, because
  `nnet.formula()` uses `softmax` there and `nnet.default()` sets
  `entropy` to `FALSE` whenever `softmax` is on — so the argument it
  collided with was never present. The criterion is now left to nnet.
  Neural networks had no test coverage at all; there are now four tests
  beyond the contract grid.

* `predict()` on a `tl_auto_ml()` model fitted with engineered features no
  longer errors on raw new data. Four of the eight candidates a typical
  search produces — the `pca_*` and `clustered_*` variants — were fitted on
  columns that exist only inside the search, so predicting on a held-out set
  failed with "object 'PC1' not found" or "object 'cluster_kmeans' not
  found". Whenever one of those won the leaderboard,
  `predict(result$best_model, new_data = ...)` was unusable. Each variant now
  records the transformation that produced its features, and `predict()`
  replays it — fitted on the training data — before dispatching.

* `predict()` on a k-means model matched `new_data` to the cluster centres by
  position, taking every numeric column in whatever order it arrived.
  A mismatched width was recycled rather than rejected, producing cluster
  numbers that looked valid and were not; a reordered frame silently measured
  distance against the wrong centres. Columns are now matched by name, and a
  missing or non-numeric column is an error naming the column.

* `predict()` on a PCA model had the same defect and now aligns `new_data` to
  the training predictors by name.

* `tl_reduce_dimensions(n_components = k)` trimmed its returned data to `k`
  components but left the reduction model projecting onto all of them, so
  `predict(result$reduction_model, new_data)` returned a wider matrix than
  the model trained on `$data` could consume. The component budget is now
  recorded on the model and honoured by `predict()`.

* XGBoost prediction pins the training factor levels, so new data missing a
  level no longer changes the contrast coding, and no longer passes
  `ntreelimit` or `reshape` to `xgboost::predict()`. Both are deprecated
  upstream and warn that they will become errors; every XGBoost prediction
  emitted two warnings per call. `tl_predict_xgboost()` gains
  `iterationrange` and accepts `ntreelimit` with a deprecation warning that
  translates it. Multiclass probabilities are reshaped to one named column
  per class whichever shape the installed xgboost returns.

### Data leakage

* `tl_pipeline()` learned imputation medians and standardisation centres
  and scales from the **whole** dataset and only then split, so every
  assessment row helped define the transformation it was scored under.
  Each fold, and each side of a train/test split, now learns its own
  statistics. The final model still uses the full-data statistics, which
  `tl_predict_pipeline()` continues to replay.

* `tl_pipeline()` also imputed the **response**, replacing missing
  outcomes with the median and turning them into both training targets
  and evaluation ground truth. Imputation now skips the response.

* `tl_auto_ml()` fitted PCA rotations and cluster centroids on all rows
  before cross-validating on the transformed data, so the `pca_*` and
  `clustered_*` candidates competed against honestly scored baselines.
  Both are now refitted inside each fold, via a new `transform` argument
  to `tl_cv()`.

### Ranking, splitting and tuning

* `tl_tune_xgboost()` also refused a grid naming a single parameter.
  `expand.grid()` of one parameter is a single-column data frame, and
  `[i, ]` on one of those drops to a bare vector with the column name
  gone, so the parameters reached xgboost unnamed and it stopped with
  "parameter names cannot be empty strings". `tl_tune_grid()` and
  `tl_tune_random()` had the same slip fixed for 0.4.0; this call site
  was missed.

* `tl_tune_xgboost()` could not complete a run. It read `best_iteration`
  from the top level of the `xgb.cv()` result, which is where xgboost kept
  it before 3.0 and not where it has been since, so every parameter set
  scored `NULL`, `which.min()` over those scores returned `integer(0)`,
  and the call died on "attempt to select less than one element in
  get1index" — on the documented default call, for any input. Both
  locations are now read. Separately, `nrounds` was hardcoded at 1000
  inside the function while `...` was forwarded to the same call, so
  passing the one argument an xgboost tuner obviously takes gave "formal
  argument \"nrounds\" matched by multiple actual arguments". It is a
  named argument now, documented as the ceiling early stopping works
  within. The function had no test; it has one now.

* `tl_tune_random()` rejects a parameter range written backwards.
  `c(0.1, 0.001)` instead of `c(0.001, 0.1)` was sampled with
  `runif(1, 0.1, 0.001)`, which is `NaN` — and R only warns — so every
  iteration drew `NaN`, models were fitted with `cp = NaN`, and
  `best_params` was reported as `NaN` without anything failing. Equal
  bounds and a non-positive lower bound on a log-uniform range are
  refused for the same reason.

* `tl_tune_random()` accepts a discrete set of numbers that are not whole.
  Only whole numbers reached the discrete branch, so
  `list(cp = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1))` — the natural way to write candidate
  values for a parameter that is never an integer — was rejected as an
  "Unsupported parameter space definition", while `tl_tune_grid()` took
  the same vector without complaint.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` name a metric they cannot
  produce. Asking for `"accuracy"` on a regression task, or for a metric
  that does not exist, failed with "replacement has length zero" from the
  assignment that came up empty. The error now says which metric was
  asked for and lists what the task does produce.

* `tl_tune_deep(learning_rates = )` searched over a value that changed
  nothing. It passed `optimizer = optimizer_adam(learning_rate = )` into
  `tl_fit_deep()`, which has no such formal, so the argument fell into
  `...` and was forwarded to `keras::fit()` — by which point the model is
  compiled, and `compile()` is what sets the optimizer. Every point on the
  grid therefore trained at the same rate, and `best_learning_rate` was
  whichever happened to score highest on noise. `tl_fit_deep()` gains a
  `learning_rate` argument that reaches `compile()`, and the final refit
  on the winning configuration uses it too.

* `tl_tune_deep()` reports when no configuration could be fitted. Each fit
  is wrapped individually, so a bad argument forwarded through `...` left
  every `val_loss` as `NA`; `which.min()` then returned `integer(0)` and
  the function failed with "attempt to select less than one element in
  get1index", which describes nothing.

* `tl_auto_ml(metric = "mape")` returned the model with the **highest**
  error as the best one — `mape` was missing from the ascending-sort
  list. Unrecognised metrics now error rather than assume a direction.
  `tl_auto_ml()` also returns `best_model_name`.

* `tl_split()` could return an empty training set *and* an empty test
  set: `floor(n * prop)` can be zero, and `data[-integer(0), ]` selects
  nothing. Every group now keeps at least one row on each side.

* `tl_tune_random()` ignored two documented parameter forms. Any
  two-element numeric was caught by the continuous branch first, so an
  integer range like `c(100, 500)` was sampled with `runif()`; and the
  log-uniform form `c(min, max, "log")` is a character vector, so its
  branch was unreachable and the literal `"log"` could be sampled as a
  value. `param_space` is now fully documented.

* `tl_pipeline()` accepted a partial `preprocessing` or `evaluation` list and
  then failed inside `tl_run_pipeline()` with "argument is of length zero".
  Both specifications now fill in their defaults for anything unnamed. An
  unrecognised name is an error rather than a step that silently does
  nothing, and `evaluation$best_metric` is checked against
  `evaluation$metrics`.

### Diagnostics

* `tl_check_assumptions()`, `tl_influence_measures()` and
  `tl_diagnostic_dashboard()` no longer fail when a predictor has a
  missing value. `lm()` drops incomplete cases, so `residuals()`,
  `fitted()` and every influence measure came back shorter than
  `model$data`, and combining them raised "arguments imply differing
  number of rows: 60, 59" — which describes nothing the caller did.

* `tl_influence_measures()` numbers observations by their row in the
  training data. It used `1:n`, so after a dropped row every observation
  was attributed to its neighbour: with row 3 missing, what the table
  called observation 3 was row 4, and so on to the end.

* `optimal_hclust_k(method = "gap")` never ran. `cluster::clusGap()`
  requires its clustering function to return a list with a `cluster`
  element and `cutree()` returns a bare integer vector, so every call
  failed with "$ operator is invalid for atomic vectors". Two further
  faults sat behind that one and could not show themselves while it
  errored on the first call: the refit used `stats::dist()`, whose default
  is Euclidean, so a model built with any other distance was scored
  against clusterings it would never produce; and a model built from a
  `dist` object has no observations to resample, which surfaced as "no
  applicable method for 'select' applied to an object of class NULL"
  rather than as an explanation. All three are fixed, and the last is now
  an error that says to refit from the data or use `"silhouette"`, which
  works from distances alone.

* `tidy_dbscan()` converted a `dist` input with `as.matrix()` and passed
  it as coordinates, clustering each observation's vector of distances
  rather than the dissimilarity. It also read a non-existent `"core"`
  attribute, so every point was reported as a non-core point.

* `tidy_kmeans()` lost its entire metrics tibble for the Lloyd, Forgy and
  MacQueen algorithms, which leave `ifault` NULL.

* `tidy_gower()` documented `weights` as a named vector but indexed it
  positionally, applying weights to the wrong variables. Named weights
  are now matched by name, and a mismatched length errors.

* `tidy_mds(method = "sammon")` and `method = "kruskal"` passed MASS's
  "zero or negative distance between objects i and j" straight through. The
  cause is duplicated rows, which the message does not say. Both now check
  first and name the offending pairs.

* `tl_plot_cv_results()` could not plot `tl_cv()` output — it read
  `$fold_metrics` and `mean_value`, which are named `$folds` and `mean`.

* Lift and gain charts indexed past the end of the data in their final
  deciles, corrupting the cumulative curve.

* The outlier plot from `tl_detect_outliers()` attached flags to the
  wrong observations whenever more than one variable was plotted.

* `plot_distance_heatmap()` sorted its axes alphabetically, moving the
  diagonal off the diagonal and discarding any `cluster_order`.

* Influence plots used unnamed colour vectors, so when every point was
  influential they all rendered in the "not influential" colour.

* `tl_plot_nn_architecture()` failed on any neural network with a single
  output unit — every regression fit, and every two-class fit once those
  could be fitted at all. `NeuralNetTools::plotnet()` evaluates
  `mod_in$call$formula` on that branch, and `nnet()` records its call
  verbatim, so what it found was the symbol `formula` resolving to
  `stats::formula`: "cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type
  'character'". `tl_fit_nn()` now substitutes the formula into the recorded
  call. Multiclass took the other branch, which is why the function's own
  example passed.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "parallel")` and
  `tl_plot_regularization_path()` used the `size` aesthetic on a line, which
  ggplot2 deprecated in 3.4.0 and which told the user to file a bug against
  tidylearn. Both use `linewidth`.

* `tidy_pca_biplot(color_by = )` and `plot_mds(color_by = )` accepted only a
  column name, but the tibbles they draw from carry an identifier and the
  coordinates — there is nowhere for a grouping variable to live, so the
  documented use was unreachable. Both now also accept a vector as long as
  the data, and a name that cannot resolve is an error rather than a plot
  that fails when printed.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` emitted "essentially perfect fit" warnings from
  `summary.lm()`. The slope is estimated by regressing the model's own fitted
  values on the grid, which for a linear model lie exactly on a line, so the
  warning was expected by construction and is no longer passed on. The
  documentation now says that `slopes$slope_se` describes the fit to the
  prediction grid rather than the uncertainty of the marginal effect.

### Data ingestion

* `tl_read_kaggle()` no longer lets a dataset slug reach the shell as
  written. The slug was interpolated into `system2()`, which applies
  `shQuote()` to the command and leaves the arguments alone, and
  `tl_parse_kaggle_url()` matched `[^/]+/[^/]+$` — which admits `;`, `|`,
  backticks and `$(`. The URL parser is also skipped entirely when the
  caller passes a bare string, so the slug was not necessarily anything
  Kaggle produced. A pasted dataset link was the vector. Slugs and file
  names are now validated against what Kaggle identifiers actually are,
  before interpolation and before the CLI is looked for, and
  caller-derived values are quoted — which also fixes a destination path
  containing spaces.

* `tl_read_kaggle(file = NULL)` downloaded into a shared `tempdir()` and
  returned the newest matching data file, so a file left by an earlier
  call could be handed back as the requested dataset. Each download now
  gets its own directory, emptied first.

* `tl_read_kaggle(type = "competition")` returned no data. Competition
  downloads arrive zipped and that endpoint has no `--unzip` flag, so the
  search for a data file found none. Archives are unpacked first, and the
  search recurses.

* `tl_read_zip(format = )` forced one format onto every member. A zip
  holding a CSV and a JSON read the JSON as CSV and row-bound the result,
  producing a frame with a column named after the JSON's first line and no
  error at all. When the archive holds more than one kind of data file,
  `format` now selects the members of that format.

### Errors instead of misleading results

* Unsupervised routines that cannot use missing values now say so, naming
  the columns and how many values are affected. `tidy_kmeans()` and
  `tidy_gap_stat()` previously surfaced `stats::kmeans()`'s "NA/NaN/Inf in
  foreign function call (arg 1)", `tidy_pca()` gave `prcomp()`'s "infinite
  or missing values in 'x'", and `calc_wss()`, `optimal_clusters()` and
  `tidy_silhouette_analysis()` loop over k with `purrr`, which wrapped
  those again into "In index: 2. Caused by error in `do_one()`". None of
  them named the column, the problem, or a way forward. Missing values are
  the most ordinary thing that can be wrong with a data set.

  The message points at `"pam"` and `"clara"`, which accept missing values.
  Those, along with `tidy_dist()`, `tidy_gower()`, `tidy_mds()` and
  `tidy_hclust()`, are unchanged — they handle missing values themselves,
  and guarding them would remove working behaviour rather than improve a
  message.

* `tl_split()` and `tl_tune_random()` no longer rewrite the session's
  random stream. Both called `set.seed()` when given a `seed`, so a
  function seeded for its own reproducibility was also deciding what every
  later `sample()` or `rnorm()` in the caller's script returned — two
  scripts differing only in whether they passed `seed` diverged everywhere
  downstream. The stream is restored on exit; the seed still does its own
  job.

* `tidy_pca(method = "princomp")` produced loadings that could not be
  used. `princomp()` returns a `"loadings"` object rather than a plain
  matrix, and `tibble::as_tibble()` read that as a single long vector — 16
  values against 4 row names for a four-variable PCA — so
  `get_pca_loadings()` failed with "Can't recycle `..1` (size 16) to match
  `..3` (size 4)". The loadings now match `prcomp()`'s, up to the sign
  convention.

* The method and the response now have to agree. `"linear"` and
  `"polynomial"` need a numeric response and `"logistic"` needs exactly two
  classes; every other supervised method takes either. A mismatch is an
  error at `tl_model()`, naming the methods that would fit.

  `tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "linear")` previously succeeded.
  `lm()` estimates from a factor's underlying integer codes — its
  coefficients are identical to regressing on `as.integer(Species)` — so
  the classes were treated as equally spaced points on a scale and
  `predict()` returned numbers between them. Nothing failed at any stage,
  which made this quieter than the logistic case: there was no later error
  to work back from.

  In the other direction, `tl_model(mtcars, mpg ~ wt, method = "logistic")`
  reported that `mpg` "has 25 levels", listed all of them, and recommended
  classification methods for what is plainly a regression problem. It now
  says the response is numeric with 25 distinct values and points at the
  regression methods, while still accepting a two-class response stored as
  0/1.

* `tl_model(method = "logistic")` now errors when the response does not have
  exactly two levels. `glm(family = binomial)` accepts a three-level factor
  without complaint and fits the first level against the other two, so
  `tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "logistic")` returned a model that
  looked fine and meant nothing. The failure surfaced three calls later, at
  `predict(type = "class")` and `tl_evaluate()`, both of which reported only
  that multiclass logistic was "not implemented" — by which point the caller
  had no reason to suspect the method choice. The error is now raised at fit
  time and names the methods that do handle more than two classes. A
  single-level response is reported separately.

  `tl_pipeline()` offered `logistic` as a default candidate for any
  classification task, so without a matching guard a three-level response
  would now fail the whole pipeline rather than one model. It offers
  `logistic` only for a two-level response, as `tl_auto_ml()` already did.

* `tl_semisupervised()`, `tl_anomaly_aware()`, `tl_transfer_learning()` and
  `tl_stratified_models()` default to `supervised_method = "tree"`. The first
  three defaulted to `"logistic"`, which cannot fit a response with more than
  two levels or a numeric one, and the fourth to `"linear"`, which fits
  `lm()` to a factor response and returns numbers rather than refusing.
  `tl_anomaly_aware(iris, Species ~ ., response = "Species")` — the function's
  own documented example — was in the first group. `"tree"` handles
  regression and classification, at any number of classes.

  This changes the model a call produces when `supervised_method` is not
  given. Pass it explicitly to keep the previous behaviour.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` and `tl_influence_measures()` advertised
  support for `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"`, but glmnet
  provides no residuals, hat values or influence measures. They now
  explain this instead of failing partway through.

* `plot_cluster_comparison()` and `create_cluster_dashboard()` called
  `gridExtra` without a `requireNamespace()` guard.

* Database connection strings carried the password into the returned
  object's `tl_source` attribute — printed on every `print()` and
  persisted by `saveRDS()` — into the progress message, and into the
  URL parse error. All are now redacted.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results()` names the valid `plot_type` values in its error
  instead of reporting "Invalid plot_type or insufficient parameters".

* `get_pca_variance()` and `get_pca_loadings()` accept a PCA model from
  `tl_model(method = "pca")` as well as a `tidy_pca()` object. The two
  representations carry the same tables under different names, and the
  accessors previously took only one of them.

* `inst/examples/unified_workflow.R` reported "Reduced from 4 to 2 features"
  after requesting three components, and passed `supervised_method =
  "logistic"` on three-class iris in three places, producing convergence
  warnings. It is now exercised by `tests/testthat/test-examples.R`, so it
  cannot drift again unnoticed.

## Documentation

* Every exported function now carries a runnable example. Thirteen had
  none: `tl_predict_pipeline()`, `tl_compare_pipeline_models()`,
  `tl_plot_cv_results()`, `tl_interaction_effects()`,
  `tl_plot_interaction()`, `tl_tune_nn()`, `tl_plot_nn_tuning()`,
  `tl_tune_xgboost()`, `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()`,
  `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_dependence()` and the three `print` methods.
  Writing them is what surfaced the `tl_tune_xgboost()` defects above.

* `tl_plot_nn_tuning()` documented the wrong input and the wrong plot. It
  takes the list `tl_tune_nn()` returns rather than a fitted model — the
  error message said so, the `@param` did not — and it draws a heatmap of
  the size-by-decay grid, not the training history its title claimed.

* `DiagrammeR` is now declared in Suggests. `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()`
  cannot render without it, reaching it through `xgboost::xgb.plot.tree()`.

* Corrected five factual errors across the docs: the README claimed ten
  articles where there are eleven; `compute-backends` said eleven CPU-only
  methods and then listed ten, omitting `"polynomial"`;
  `integration-workflows` still documented `tl_semisupervised()` as
  defaulting to `supervised_method = "logistic"` after it changed to
  `"tree"`; `tuning-and-pipelines` wrote 6 x 3 = 19 fits; and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` gave its versioning worked example against 0.3.0,
  telling contributors to open a NEWS heading a release out of date.

* Rewrote `integration-workflows` and `reporting`, which had drifted from
  the register of the other nine articles. Their generic "Best Practices"
  and "Summary" sections are gone, each function now gets a sentence on
  what it buys you and what it costs, and the train-then-replay rule that
  governs all five integration functions is stated once up front rather
  than only in code comments.

* Removed duplicated prose. The overview blurb, the "what tidylearn is /
  is NOT" bullets and the principles list each existed verbatim in two or
  three of README, `getting-started` and `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`;
  `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` now links to the README for all three, the way
  it already did for the method-to-package table. `getting-started` and
  `supervised-learning` no longer close with a summary restating their own
  introductions.

* New vignette `compute-backends`: how `compute = "auto"` routes a fit, what
  the advisor estimates a cloud tier would cost, and the safety model that
  governs data egress.

* New vignette `market-basket`: the association rules family
  (`tidy_apriori()`, `inspect_rules()`, `filter_rules_by_item()`,
  `find_related_items()`, `recommend_products()`, `summarize_rules()`,
  `visualize_rules()`) had no narrative documentation.

* New vignette `tuning-and-pipelines`: `tl_tune_grid()`, `tl_tune_random()`,
  `tl_default_param_grid()`, `tl_plot_tuning_results()` and the
  `tl_pipeline()` family, none of which were covered.

* New vignette `diagnostics`: `tl_check_assumptions()`,
  `tl_influence_measures()`, `tl_detect_outliers()`,
  `tl_diagnostic_dashboard()`, `tl_compare_cv()`,
  `tl_test_model_difference()`, `tl_test_interactions()`,
  `tl_interaction_effects()` and `tl_explore()`.

* `unsupervised-learning` rewritten to use the package's own `tidy_*()` and
  `augment_*()` interface. It previously reached into `model$fit$clusters`,
  `$fit$centers`, `$fit$loadings` and `$fit$variance_explained` throughout,
  and hand-rolled an elbow search, while `optimal_clusters()`,
  `plot_elbow()`, `plot_silhouette()`, `suggest_eps()` and
  `explore_dbscan_params()` went unmentioned.

* `automl` now executes. Twenty-three of its twenty-five chunks were
  `eval = FALSE`, with hand-written `#>` lines that read as console output
  and were not. The budget-tier table of predicted model counts is replaced
  by a sweep that measures them.

* `integration-workflows` no longer emits 135 recycling warnings from the
  PCA-then-cluster workflow, and its reported accuracy is no longer computed
  from mis-assigned clusters.

* `supervised-learning` seeds the missing-values example, which was
  unreproducible across builds.

* README links the documentation site and every article; `inst/CITATION`
  reports the installed version and year rather than a hard-coded 2025.

* `inst/security/threat-model.md` is rewritten for the architecture the
  transport spike settled on: plain HTTPS to a Modal Web Function backed by
  an R worker, rather than reticulate driving the Python SDK. T1 and T4
  named constraints that no longer apply, and no threat covered a
  user-supplied endpoint URL.

## Internal

* Removed four internal helpers with no callers: `create_obs_ids()`,
  `extract_response()`, `get_numeric_cols()` and `validate_data()`. They had
  survived two reviews on the grounds that they looked like intentional
  utilities.

* `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` builds on pull requests without deploying,
  so a dangling article name fails a PR check rather than the first push to
  main, and deploys with `clean: true` so removed pages leave the live site.


# tidylearn 0.4.0

## New Features

### Compute backends (foundation)

* `tl_check_gpu()` — detects local NVIDIA CUDA support and reports which
  GPU-capable backends (xgboost, keras, tensorflow, torch) are
  installed. Cheap detection: parses `nvidia-smi` output and checks
  installed packages without loading Python or fitting a model. Returns
  a `tidylearn_gpu_check` object with a `print()` method.

* `tl_compute_advisor()` — S3 generic that estimates runtime, peak RAM,
  and cost across local CPU, local GPU, and cloud GPU tiers for a given
  tidylearn method and dataset. Dispatches on either a method name
  (`character`) or a fitted `tidylearn_supervised` model. Returns a
  structured recommendation with a `print()` method. Cloud-tier
  estimates are reported but not yet executable; Modal integration will
  follow in a later iteration.

### Compute backends (local GPU routing)

* `tl_model()` now accepts a `compute` argument on both supervised and
  unsupervised paths: `"cpu"` (default — existing behaviour), `"gpu"`
  (route to local CUDA when the method supports it), `"auto"` (consult
  `tl_compute_advisor()` and pick per call), or `"cloud"` (reserved;
  errors with a clear message until the Modal integration lands).

* `tl_fit_xgboost(compute = "gpu")` passes `device = "cuda"` to
  `xgb.train()`. Requires xgboost compiled with CUDA support.

* `tl_fit_deep(compute = "gpu")` defers to TensorFlow's automatic CUDA
  detection — the argument is accepted for API consistency but does not
  itself change the keras model setup.

* All compute validation flows through `tl_resolve_compute()` so the
  behaviour is uniform across paradigms: methods without an upstream
  GPU path (linear, glm, randomForest, pca, kmeans, etc.) warn and fall
  back to CPU when `"gpu"` is requested; `"cloud"` errors the same way
  on supervised and unsupervised methods. The resolved tier is recorded
  on `model$spec$compute` for both paradigms.

### Compute backends (cloud reframed as memory-headroom tier)

* `tl_compute_advisor()` now treats cloud as a "doesn't fit on my
  machine" tier rather than a GPU-acceleration-only tier. Cloud
  estimates are produced for every method the advisor supports (not
  just GPU-eligible ones), and the recommendation flips to `"cloud"`
  whenever the local job is RAM-infeasible — including CPU-only
  methods like linear regression, SVM or random forest on very large
  data.

  Scope: the advisor covers the 13 supervised methods in
  `.tl_method_profiles`. Unsupervised methods (PCA, k-means, MDS,
  clustering) are not modelled and calling the advisor on one errors.
  Reaching the cloud recommendation through `tl_model(compute =
  "auto")` additionally requires a method with an upstream GPU path
  (`xgboost`, `deep`), since `tl_resolve_compute()` short-circuits
  CPU-only methods to `"cpu"` before consulting the advisor. Call
  `tl_compute_advisor()` directly to get memory-headroom advice for the
  other supervised methods.

* New internal Modal instance tier table (`.tl_modal_tiers`) listing
  CPU-RAM tiers (`cpu-small`, `cpu-large`, `cpu-xlarge`) alongside GPU
  tiers (`t4`, `a10g`, `a100-40gb`, `a100-80gb`). The advisor picks the
  cheapest viable tier for the workload based on RAM headroom and
  whether the method has an upstream GPU path. Pricing is approximate
  as of early 2026 and may drift; revise if Modal pricing changes.

* The advisor's recommendation is no longer gated on
  `cloud$configured`. The advisor advises optimally; the caller
  (`tl_resolve_compute()`) decides whether it can act on a cloud
  recommendation. When `compute = "auto"` and the advisor recommends
  cloud, `tl_resolve_compute()` emits a clear message that cloud isn't
  yet wired up and falls back to local CPU.

* Print method updated: the cloud line now shows the chosen tier label
  (e.g., `T4 (16 GB VRAM / 16 GB RAM)`) alongside the time and cost
  estimate.

### Compute backends (security threat model)

* Added `inst/security/threat-model.md` — the contract for what
  cloud compute in tidylearn will and will not do once the Modal
  integration lands. Covers token handling (never read in R), data
  egress consent (per-call `confirm_upload = TRUE` plus session-level
  `tl_cloud_consent()`), ephemeral compute (no persistent Modal
  volumes by default), no telemetry, and an audit checklist that
  reviewers can grep / verify against the Modal-integration PR. The
  doc is shipped with the package so users (and CRAN reviewers) can
  find it via `system.file("security/threat-model.md", package =
  "tidylearn")`.

## Bug Fixes

These four defects produced plausible but wrong numbers rather than
errors, so results computed with earlier versions should be rechecked.

* `tl_evaluate()` scored classification models against raw prediction
  output rather than class labels. Because the default `predict()` type
  returns probabilities for logistic regression, comparing them to
  factor labels gave an accuracy of exactly 0 for every logistic model.
  Evaluation now requests `type = "class"` explicitly. Everything built
  on `tl_evaluate()` was affected — `tl_cv()`, `tl_tune_grid()`,
  `tl_tune_random()`, `tl_run_pipeline()`, `tl_auto_ml()` and
  `tl_compare_cv()` all ranked logistic models last regardless of how
  they actually performed.

* `tl_evaluate()` had no `metrics` argument, so a requested metric
  silently landed in `...` and was forwarded to `predict()`. Only
  accuracy (classification) or rmse/mae/rsq (regression) were ever
  returned. `tl_evaluate()` now takes `metrics` and computes the
  requested set, delegating to `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` for
  classification. Classification supports accuracy, precision, recall,
  sensitivity, specificity, f1, auc and pr_auc; regression supports
  rmse, mse, mae, mape and rsq. `tl_cv()` gains a matching `metrics`
  argument. This removes the "Could not determine best model ... all
  values NA" warning from default pipeline runs and the
  `replacement has length zero` error from
  `tl_tune_grid(metric = "f1")`.

  Regression `rsq` is now `1 - SS_res/SS_tot` rather than the squared
  correlation. The two agree for in-sample OLS; the squared correlation
  was optimistic on held-out data.

* `tl_predict_pipeline()` derived its centre and scale from
  `results$processed_data`, which is stored *after* standardization —
  so new data was rescaled against a mean of ~0 and an sd of ~1 and
  reached the model in raw units. On `mtcars` with `mpg ~ wt + hp` this
  returned predictions near -230 for rows whose actual mpg was 21. The
  same defect made imputation substitute a standardized median (~0) for
  missing values instead of the raw-scale one. `tl_run_pipeline()` now
  records the medians, modes, centres and scales it learned in
  `results$preprocessing_stats`, and `tl_predict_pipeline()` applies
  those. Pipelines run by an earlier version carry no such statistics
  and now raise a clear error asking for a re-run rather than silently
  producing wrong predictions. Constant columns are centred without
  dividing by zero.

* `tl_auto_ml()`'s leaderboard scores were always `NA`.
  `create_leaderboard()` expected a result shape that neither
  `tl_cv()` nor `tl_evaluate()` produces, so every model scored `NA`
  and the reported "best model" was whichever trained first. Score
  extraction now handles both shapes, and the target metric is passed
  through to every evaluation.

* `predict()` on unsupervised models used `nrow(new_data) ==
  nrow(object$data)` to decide whether new data had been supplied. Any
  new data with the same number of rows as the training set silently
  got the training result back — verified with a PCA projection of an
  all-999 frame returning the training scores. `predict()` now tracks
  whether the caller supplied `new_data` rather than inferring it from
  row count. This also affected `predict.tidylearn_transfer()` and
  `predict.tidylearn_stratified()`, which delegate to it.

  Methods with no out-of-sample projection (PAM, CLARA, MDS, DBSCAN,
  hierarchical clustering) now error when handed new data instead of
  returning training assignments that look like predictions. PAM and
  CLARA gained the training-data branch they previously lacked, and
  hierarchical clustering — whose fit holds a tree, not assignments —
  points at `tidy_cutree()` rather than returning `NULL`.

* Prediction for `ridge`, `lasso` and `elastic_net` built its design
  matrix from a `~ predictors - 1` formula while the fit used
  `model.matrix()` with the intercept dropped. The two disagree
  whenever a factor predictor is present: the fit uses treatment
  contrasts (k-1 columns), prediction one-hot encodes (k columns), so
  any such model failed with `The number of variables in newx must be
  N`. The fit now records its terms and factor levels, and prediction
  rebuilds an identically-coded design matrix from them.

* Regularized classification ignored the `type` argument and always
  returned class labels, so `type = "prob"` gave labels and ROC,
  calibration, lift and gain plots could not work for these models.
  `type = "prob"` now returns one probability column per class (binary
  and multinomial), and `type = "class"`/`"response"` returns a factor
  carrying the training levels rather than a character vector. An
  unrecognised type errors instead of silently returning labels.

* `method = "boost"` could not fit a classification model at all:
  `gbm()` was handed a factor response with `distribution =
  "bernoulli"`, which requires a numeric 0/1 response. The response is
  now encoded with the second factor level as the positive class,
  matching the orientation `tl_predict_boost()` already assumed.

* `plot()` failed for every unsupervised method. The `tl_fit_*`
  wrappers unpack the `tidy_*` objects into plain lists, but the plot
  helpers were handed the unpacked list: k-means, PAM, CLARA and
  DBSCAN partial-matched `$cluster` to the `$clusters` tibble and built
  a nested column; PCA and MDS hit `tidy_pca`/`tidy_mds` class checks
  that a plain list cannot satisfy; hclust passed a list where an
  `hclust` object was expected. Each method now supplies the structure
  its plot helper expects.

### Compute backends (corrections)

* `parallel` is now declared in Imports. `tl_estimate_local_cpu_internal()`
  calls `parallel::detectCores()`, which without the declaration produces
  an "'::' call not declared from" NOTE under `R CMD check`.

* `testthat` minimum raised to 3.1.7. The compute tests use
  `local_mocked_bindings()` (3.1.7) and `expect_no_warning()` (3.1.5);
  on an older testthat the suite errored rather than skipped.

* `tl_detect_cuda_internal()` now checks the exit status of `nvidia-smi`.
  A machine with the binary installed but the driver unloaded prints its
  error message to stdout and exits non-zero — that text was being parsed
  as a device name, so `tl_check_gpu()` reported a working GPU and
  `compute = "gpu"` routed `device = "cuda"` into a fit that then failed.

* GPU routing for xgboost now requires xgboost >= 2.0.0, checked during
  backend detection. The `device` parameter arrived in 2.0.0; older
  versions ignore unknown parameters, so the fit ran on CPU while
  `spec$compute` recorded `"gpu"`. Older versions are now reported as
  having no GPU path, so `compute = "gpu"` warns and falls back honestly.

* `tl_model(compute = "auto")` now forwards the caller's runtime-relevant
  hyperparameters to the advisor. Previously the advisor always estimated
  a default-sized job, so `tl_model(..., method = "xgboost", nrounds =
  5000, compute = "auto")` was costed as `nrounds = 100` and could choose
  CPU when GPU was the right call.

* `tl_compute_advisor()` no longer skips a local GPU that finishes
  quickly. The guard required an estimated GPU runtime of at least 5
  seconds on top of a 3x speedup, so a job estimated at 70s on CPU and
  4.7s on GPU — a 15x speedup — was reported as "No meaningfully faster
  tier available". The sub-60s check earlier in the same function
  already covers jobs too small to bother offloading.

* `tl_compute_advisor(fitted_model, formula = ...)` no longer errors with
  "formal argument 'formula' matched by multiple actual arguments". The
  documentation says `formula` is ignored for a fitted model; now it
  actually is.

## Other Changes

* `tl_auto_ml()` now cross-validates the PCA-augmented and
  cluster-augmented variants when the budget allows. Previously these
  were scored on training data while baselines were cross-validated, so
  once scoring worked at all, overfit variants would have outranked
  honestly-scored models. The leaderboard gains an `evaluation` column
  recording `"cv"` or `"train"` per model, since mixed scores are not
  directly comparable.

* `tl_auto_ml()` no longer fits logistic regression to a multiclass
  response — the implementation is binary-only, and the resulting model
  was meaningless. It errors early when the response has fewer than two
  observed classes.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` rejects an unnamed `models` argument. Passing a
  character vector previously trained nothing and failed later with an
  indexing error.

* `tl_evaluate()` errors when the response column is absent from
  `new_data` instead of computing metrics against `NULL`.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` failed with "argument is of
  length zero" whenever a `metric` was named without also naming
  `maximize`. The optimisation direction was only assigned inside the
  branch that supplies a default metric, so an explicit metric left
  `maximize` at `NULL` and the later `if (maximize)` errored. Direction
  now follows the metric itself: `rmse`, `mse`, `mae` and `mape` are
  minimised, everything else maximised. An explicitly supplied
  `maximize` is still respected.

* Tuning a single hyperparameter dropped its name. Indexing one column
  of the results without `drop = FALSE` collapsed the row to a bare
  value, so the winning setting was passed to `tl_model()` positionally
  and never reached the underlying fit — a tuned `cp` or `lambda` was
  silently discarded. Affected both `tl_tune_grid()` and
  `tl_tune_random()`.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "importance")` errored on
  categorical parameters with "Can't subset `.data` outside of a data
  mask context". The ANOVA branch built its formula with the tidy-eval
  `.data` pronoun, which `aov()` cannot evaluate; it now uses
  `stats::reformulate()`.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "grid")` errored with "object 'p'
  not found" when a parameter had more than 20 unique values. The
  fallback to a scatter plot called the function recursively but
  discarded the result.

## Tests

* New `test-metrics.R` and `test-pipeline.R` cover the four fixes
  above; `tl_evaluate()` and the whole pipeline family previously had
  no test coverage, which is why the defects survived. Added
  leaderboard scoring and ranking tests to `test-workflows.R`.

* `tl_auto_ml handles small datasets` used `iris[1:30, ]`, which is
  entirely setosa. It passed only because a degenerate single-class
  logistic model was counted as a trained model. It now samples across
  all three species, and a separate test covers the single-class
  rejection.

* New `test-supervised-predict.R` and `test-unsupervised-predict.R`
  cover the prediction fixes above, and `tests/testthat/setup.R` draws
  base-graphics test plots to a null device so they no longer leave an
  `Rplots.pdf` behind.

## Documentation

* Corrected vignette examples that printed wrong results. The
  integration-workflows vignette reported 0% accuracy in five places —
  it compared logistic regression's probability output against factor
  labels, on a three-class response that logistic regression cannot
  represent. The supervised-learning vignette reported 33.3% (chance)
  for its complete-workflow example, which fitted on standardized
  features and then predicted on raw test data. Both now use
  multiclass-capable methods, score through `tl_evaluate()`, and apply
  the training preprocessing to the test set.

* The getting-started and supervised-learning vignettes now explain
  that `predict()`'s default `type = "response"` returns probabilities
  for logistic regression but class labels for trees and forests, and
  show `type = "class"` and `type = "prob"` alongside `tl_evaluate()`.

* Re-enabled seven vignette chunks that were disabled while the
  underlying bugs were present: ridge, lasso, elastic net and SVM in
  the supervised-learning vignette, and PAM, DBSCAN and CLARA in the
  unsupervised-learning vignette.

* Added package-level documentation, so `?tidylearn` now resolves.

* README: fixed a `predict()` example that referenced columns which do
  not exist, replaced a `plot_clusters()` call that passed a model
  where a data frame is required, and added a section on the compute
  backends.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` documents the `$preprocessing_stats` component,
  and `predict()` no longer advertises unsupervised `type` values that
  it ignores — its `@return` now describes the shape unsupervised
  models actually produce, and which of them accept `new_data`.

* `tl_check_gpu()` and `tl_compute_advisor()` examples now run rather
  than sitting in `\dontrun{}`; neither requires a GPU.

# tidylearn 0.3.1

## Performance

* `tidy_gower()` — eliminated two layers of redundant work in the pairwise
  distance loop:
  * Column ranges (`max - min`) and ordinal rank vectors were previously
    recomputed on every `(i, j)` pair. They are now computed once in a
    pre-pass, reducing work from O(n² × p) to O(n² + p).
  * Replaced scalar data-frame indexing `data[i, k]` — which dispatches to
    the R-level `[.data.frame` method on every call — with pre-extracted
    plain-vector access `col_vecs[[k]][i]`, which resolves at the C level.
    Benchmarks show 10–100× faster scalar access; the gain compounds across
    the full `n*(n-1)/2 * p` iterations.
  * Column types (`is.numeric`, `is.ordered`) are now resolved once into a
    `col_type` character vector, removing repeated S3 predicate calls from
    the inner loop.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `tl_reduce_dimensions()` returning the internal `.obs_id` row
  identifier as a column of its `$data` result. Passing that data to a
  supervised model via a `response ~ .` formula fed `.obs_id` in as a
  high-cardinality predictor, which made tree-based fits effectively
  non-terminating. The identifier is now dropped from the returned data,
  consistent with how the pipeline and transfer-learning paths already
  handle it.
* Fixed `print()` and `summary()` erroring on the model objects returned
  by `tl_step_selection()` and `tl_tune_xgboost()`. Both constructed their
  object without the `spec$paradigm` field or the `tidylearn_supervised`
  class, so the print method hit a zero-length `if` condition and
  `summary()` took the unsupervised branch. Both objects are now built
  consistently with `tl_model()`.
* Fixed `tidy_gower()` (and `tidy_dist(..., method = "gower")`) erroring on
  single-row input. The pairwise loop used `1:(n - 1)`, which produces the
  invalid sequence `1:0` when `n` is 1; it now uses `seq_len(n - 1)`, so a
  single-row data frame returns an empty `dist` object, consistent with
  `stats::dist()`.

## Tests

* Added 11 tests for `tidy_gower()` / `tidy_dist(..., method = "gower")`
  covering: return type and metadata, symmetry and self-distance, identical
  rows, hand-verified numeric / categorical / ordered / mixed-type distances,
  NA skipping, custom weights, constant-column denominator behaviour, and
  single-row input.

## Internal

* Removed seven unused packages from `Suggests` (caret, mclust, onnx,
  parsnip, recipes, reticulate, workflows) — none were referenced in
  package code, tests, or vignettes.


# tidylearn 0.3.0

## New Features

### Data Ingestion (`tl_read()` Family)

* New `tl_read()` dispatcher function — auto-detects format from file
  extension, URL pattern, or connection string and routes to the appropriate
  reader
* All readers return a `tidylearn_data` object, a tibble subclass carrying
  source, format, and timestamp metadata via `print.tidylearn_data()`

#### File Format Readers

* `tl_read_csv()` / `tl_read_tsv()` — via readr with base R fallback
* `tl_read_excel()` — `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` files via readxl
* `tl_read_parquet()` — via nanoparquet
* `tl_read_json()` — tabular JSON via jsonlite
* `tl_read_rds()` / `tl_read_rdata()` — native R formats via base R

#### Database Readers

* `tl_read_db()` — query any live DBI connection
* `tl_read_sqlite()` — auto-connect to SQLite files via RSQLite
* `tl_read_postgres()` — connection string or named params via RPostgres
* `tl_read_mysql()` — connection string or named params via RMariaDB
* `tl_read_bigquery()` — Google BigQuery via bigrquery

#### Cloud/API Readers

* `tl_read_s3()` — download and read from S3 URIs via paws.storage
* `tl_read_github()` — download raw files from GitHub repositories
* `tl_read_kaggle()` — download datasets via the Kaggle CLI

#### Multi-File Reading

* `tl_read()` accepts a character vector of paths — reads each and row-binds
  with a `source_file` column
* `tl_read_dir()` — scan a directory for data files with optional format,
  pattern, and recursive filtering
* `tl_read_zip()` — extract and read from zip archives, with optional file
  selection
* All backend packages are suggested dependencies, checked at call time via
  `tl_check_packages()`

### New Vignette

* Added "Data Ingestion with tidylearn" vignette covering all readers,
  databases, cloud sources, multi-file reading, and the full pipeline
* Updated "Getting Started" vignette to include `tl_read()` in the workflow

## Bug Fixes

### Workflow and Pipeline Fixes

* Fixed `tl_transfer_learning()` hanging indefinitely when used with PCA
  pre-training. The `.obs_id` row-identifier column from PCA output was
  being included in the supervised formula, creating a massive dummy-variable
  matrix. The column is now stripped before both training and prediction.
* Fixed `tl_run_pipeline()` failing with "attempt to select less than one
  element" when all cross-validation metrics were NA. Root cause: `scale()`
  returned matrix columns instead of vectors, causing downstream metric
  computation to produce NaN. Added `as.vector()` wrapper and hardened the
  best-model selection to handle all-NA metric values gracefully.
* Overhauled `tl_auto_ml()` time budget enforcement. The budget now controls
  which models are attempted: budgets under 30s skip slow C-level models
  (forest, SVM, XGBoost) entirely, and cross-validation is skipped when
  remaining time is tight. Baseline model order changed to fast-first
  (tree, logistic/linear, then forest). See `?tl_auto_ml` for full details
  on budget tiers.

### Interaction and Prediction Fixes

* Fixed `tl_interaction_effects()` crashing with "unused argument (se.fit)"
  because tidylearn's `predict()` method does not support `se.fit`. Now uses
  `stats::predict()` on the raw model object for confidence intervals. Also
  fixed an invalid formula in the internal slope calculation.
* Fixed `tl_plot_interaction()` expecting `fit`/`lwr`/`upr` columns from
  `predict()` output. Now correctly handles tidylearn's `.pred` tibble
  format.

### Visualization Fixes

* Fixed `tl_plot_intervals()` calling non-existent `tl_prediction_intervals()`
  function. Now computes confidence and prediction intervals directly via
  `stats::predict(..., interval = "confidence")` and
  `stats::predict(..., interval = "prediction")`.
* Fixed `tl_plot_svm_boundary()` erroring with "at least two predictor
  variables required" when using `response ~ .` formulas. The function now
  resolves predictors from data column names instead of `all.vars()`, which
  does not expand `.`. Also switched from `geom_contour_filled` (which
  failed on discrete class predictions) to `geom_raster`.
* Fixed `tl_plot_svm_tuning()` passing `NULL` entries in the `ranges` list
  to `e1071::tune()`, which caused "NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call"
  errors. Tuning ranges are now built conditionally based on the kernel type.
* Fixed `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_summary()` failing with "arguments imply
  differing number of rows" when `n_samples` differed from `nrow(data)`.
  Sampling is now performed before SHAP computation so that feature values
  and SHAP values always have the same number of rows.

### Other Fixes

* Fixed classification auto-detection silently treating numeric responses
  with <= 10 unique values as classification. The response must now be a
  factor or character for classification; a helpful message is emitted when
  a low-cardinality numeric response is detected.
* Fixed `tl_check_assumptions()` crashing with "list object cannot be
  coerced to logical" when some assumption checks returned NULL (e.g.,
  when optional test packages were not installed).
* Fixed SVM default `gamma` calculation to use predictor count only
  (`1 / (ncol(data) - 1)`) instead of including the response column.
* Added missing `@return` tag to `print.tidylearn_data()`.
* Replaced deprecated ggplot2 `size` parameter with `linewidth` in all
  `geom_line()` calls across visualization, classification, PCA, DBSCAN,
  and validation plotting functions.

## Tests

* Added test suite for visualization module (26 tests) — plot dispatch,
  regression/classification plots, lift/gain charts, model comparison,
  unsupervised visualization, and Shiny dashboard.
* Added test suite for tuning module (49 tests) — `tl_default_param_grid`,
  `tl_tune_grid`, `tl_tune_random`, `tl_plot_tuning_results`, and input
  validation.
* Added test suite for diagnostics module (75 tests) — influence measures,
  influence plots, assumption checking, and outlier detection across all
  methods (IQR, z-score, Cook's, Mahalanobis).

## Code Quality

* Package-wide lint cleanup — all R source files, tests, and vignettes
  now pass lintr with zero issues
* Replaced unsafe `1:n` patterns with `seq_len()` / `seq_along()`
* Removed unused variables across the codebase
* Renamed non-snake_case variables to follow R conventions
* Added `.lintr` configuration enforcing `%>%` pipe consistency

# tidylearn 0.2.0

## New Features

### Formatted gt Tables

* New `tl_table()` dispatcher function — mirrors `plot()` but produces
  formatted `gt` tables instead of ggplot2 visualisations
* `tl_table_metrics()` — styled evaluation metrics table from `tl_evaluate()`
* `tl_table_coefficients()` — model coefficients with p-values (lm/glm) or
  sorted by magnitude (glmnet), with conditional highlighting
* `tl_table_confusion()` — confusion matrix with correct predictions
  highlighted on the diagonal
* `tl_table_importance()` — ranked feature importance with colour gradient
* `tl_table_variance()` — PCA variance explained with cumulative % coloured
* `tl_table_loadings()` — PCA loadings with diverging red–blue colour scale
* `tl_table_clusters()` — cluster sizes and mean feature values for kmeans,
  pam, clara, dbscan, and hclust models
* `tl_table_comparison()` — side-by-side multi-model comparison table
* All table functions share a consistent `gt` theme via internal
  `tl_gt_theme()` helper
* `gt` is a suggested dependency — functions error with an install message if
  `gt` is not available

### New Vignette

* Added "Reporting with tidylearn" vignette covering all plot and table
  functions

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `tl_fit_dbscan()` returning a non-existent `core_points` field
  instead of `summary` from the underlying `tidy_dbscan()` result

# tidylearn 0.1.1

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `plot()` failing on supervised models with
  "could not find function 'tl_plot_model'" by implementing the missing
  `tl_plot_model()` and `tl_plot_unsupervised()` internal dispatchers
  ([#1](https://github.com/ces0491/tidylearn/issues/1))
* Fixed `tl_plot_actual_predicted()`, `tl_plot_residuals()`, and
  `tl_plot_confusion()` failing due to accessing a non-existent `$prediction`
  column on predict output (correct column is `$.pred`)
* Fixed the same `$prediction` column mismatch in the `tl_dashboard()`
  predictions table
