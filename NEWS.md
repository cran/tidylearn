# tidylearn 0.5.0

## New Features

### Cloud compute (security guards)

* `tl_cloud_consent()` — grants or revokes permission for the rest of the
  R session to upload training data to your Modal account. Cloud fits
  otherwise require `confirm_upload = TRUE` on every call. The lock is
  never written to disk and does not survive an R restart, and tidylearn
  never prompts interactively, so scripts and CI behave the same as an
  interactive session.

* Cloud endpoints are read from the `TIDYLEARN_MODAL_ENDPOINT`
  environment variable and validated before any request is built: the
  scheme must be `https` and the host must be on the allowlist.
  Lookalikes such as `modal.run.example.com` or `evil-modal.run` are
  rejected. The endpoint is user-supplied configuration, so this check is
  what stops a typo or a modified variable sending training data
  somewhere other than Modal. An environment variable is used rather than
  an R option because an option can be set silently by a shared
  `.Rprofile`.

* `tl_cloud_allow_host()` and `tl_cloud_allowed_hosts()` — the allowlist
  defaults to Modal's own domains, and Modal customers serving Web
  Functions from a custom domain can extend it. Extension is a
  per-session call rather than an option or environment variable, for the
  same reason: nothing inherited from the environment should be able to
  add an upload destination. Added hosts must be bare host names, and a
  single label such as `"com"` is refused because it would open an entire
  top-level domain.

  These implement T2 and T9 of
  `system.file("security/threat-model.md", package = "tidylearn")`.
  Submission itself is still not wired up — `compute = "cloud"` continues
  to error.

### Cloud compute (model serialisation)

* Internal helpers now convert a fitted model to bytes and back for
  transport from a remote worker. Twelve of the thirteen supervised
  methods survive base R serialisation unchanged, xgboost included — its
  booster is embedded in the byte stream rather than left as a dangling
  pointer.

  `method = "deep"` is the exception and is handled separately: a keras
  model is a reference to a Python object and cannot cross a process
  boundary that way, so its weights travel as their own hdf5 payload via
  `keras::serialize_model()`. Detection is by the presence of a Python
  object rather than by method name or keras class, because keras renamed
  its classes between versions and matching those would silently stop
  detecting models on one side of the change.

## Bug Fixes

Several of these changed reported numbers. Results produced by 0.4.0 and
earlier should be recomputed.

### Degenerate inputs

* `tl_model(method = "forest")` hung indefinitely on a classification
  response whose predictors were all constant. randomForest's
  classification path keeps drawing `mtry` candidates looking for a split
  that cannot exist, and the loop is C-level, so it ignored interrupts and
  the session had to be killed. It was reachable through `tl_pipeline()`,
  whose default candidates include a forest, and through `tl_auto_ml()`,
  whose baselines do. Now refused before the call, naming the columns.
  Regression is unaffected and still fits, as does a frame where only some
  predictors are constant. The predictor set is read through `terms()`, so
  a `.` is expanded against the data and an exclusion such as `y ~ . - id`
  is honoured.

* A character specification such as `"Species ~ ."` was read as a
  regression problem by every entry point except `tl_model()`.
  `tl_model_supervised()` coerces with `as.formula()`, but that happens
  after `tl_pipeline()`, `tl_prepare_data()`, `tl_cv()`, `tl_auto_ml()`
  and the two tuners have already called `all.vars(formula)[1]` -- and
  `all.vars()` on a string is `character(0)`, so the response name came
  back `NA` and `data[[NA]]` was `NULL`. `tl_auto_ml(iris, "Species ~ .")`
  announced "task: regression" and returned an unranked leaderboard;
  `tl_pipeline()` scored a classification tree with `rmse` and returned a
  pipeline whose every metric was `NA`, warning only that the values were
  missing. Coercion now happens at each entry point, before anything reads
  the formula, and an argument that is neither a formula nor a string that
  parses as one is refused by name.

* A repeated name in `tl_pipeline(models = ...)` silently discarded a
  model. The training loop indexes `models[[model_name]]`, which resolves
  to the first match, so `list(a = tree, a = forest)` fitted the tree
  twice and never fitted the forest. Repeated names are now refused, next
  to the existing guard for unnamed ones.

* Malformed entries in `models` reported base R internals that named
  neither the model nor the mistake: a spec with no `method` gave "missing
  value where TRUE/FALSE needed", a spec that was not a list gave "$
  operator is invalid for atomic vectors", a two-element `method` gave
  "'length = 2' in coercion to 'logical(1)'", and an unsupervised method
  gave "undefined columns selected". Each is now checked before the run
  starts and names the offending model.

* `evaluation$cv_folds` and `evaluation$train_prop` were unvalidated.
  `train_prop = 0` reached base R as "result would be too long a vector",
  `train_prop = 1` surfaced as a ROCR complaint about class counts, and
  `train_prop = 1.5` as "cannot take a sample larger than the
  population"; bad fold counts arrived as rsample errors naming `v`, which
  is not an argument of anything the caller wrote. Both are now checked
  against their own names, and both are checked again against the row
  count when the pipeline runs: more folds than rows is reported as such,
  and so is a `train_prop` that is in range but rounds to an empty side on
  a small frame. `evaluation$validation` and `evaluation$best_metric` were
  in the same position one step earlier -- set to `NULL` they were dropped
  from the list and reached `%in%` as "argument is of length zero" -- and
  are now reported by name too.

* An unrecognised name in `evaluation$metrics` was accepted, computed
  nothing, and left the run warning that all values were `NA` -- the
  symptom rather than the cause. Unknown metrics are now refused with the
  list of available ones, matching what `tl_tune_grid()` already did. An
  empty metric set is refused too; it previously rendered the
  `best_metric` error as a bare full stop. The list is judged against the
  task the pipeline will actually fit, `tl_model()`'s logistic rule
  included: `method = "logistic"` on a 0/1 integer response fits a
  classification model and each fold reports classification metrics, so
  `accuracy` and `auc` are accepted there.

* A numeric response with both logistic and any other supervised method
  among the candidates gave one run two tasks. The leaderboard holds one
  set of metrics, so whichever way they were chosen the other models
  scored `NA` and dropped out of the comparison silently -- `logistic`
  plus `linear` on a 0/1 column ranked logistic at 0.6998 and reported
  nothing at all for linear. The mixture is now refused where the models
  are read, naming the methods on each side. A factor response is
  unaffected: there is one task there, and mixing methods is the ordinary
  case.

* A response that is not a column of `data` -- a typo in the formula --
  read as `NULL` in `tl_pipeline()`, which set regression defaults and
  failed several steps later inside rpart with "object 'Speces' not
  found". It is now refused where the formula is read, listing the columns
  that are there.

* An intercept-only formula (`y ~ 1`) reached `tl_run_pipeline()` and
  failed with "result would be too long a vector". A pipeline preprocesses
  and scores predictors, so it now says it needs at least one.

* A single-class response was named plainly only by logistic regression.
  Every other classification method reported whatever its backend hit
  first: rpart "number of rows of matrices must match (see arg 2)", glmnet
  "non-conformable arguments", e1071 "Model is empty!", xgboost a
  complaint about `num_class`. Ten of the thirteen supervised methods now
  give the same message, naming the response and the class it holds.
  `linear` and `polynomial` keep the numeric-response message they already
  had, which now says the response holds a single class rather than
  offering classification methods that would refuse it in turn, and
  logistic regression keeps its own wording.

* `method = "forest"` and `method = "svm"` derived their defaults from
  the number of columns in the frame rather than the number of predictors
  in the formula, so an explicit formula over a wider frame got the wrong
  one. `mpg ~ wt + hp` on `mtcars` asked randomForest for `mtry = 3` of 2
  predictors, which it reset with a warning, and asked e1071 for a kernel
  width of 1/10 instead of 1/2, with nothing said at all.
  `Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width` on `iris` asked for `mtry = 2` of
  2, also in silence -- every predictor sampled at every split, which is
  bagging rather than a random forest. Neither default is computed now:
  where the caller and the tuner leave the argument unset, it is left
  unset, and the wrapped package applies the same default it documents.
  A `y ~ .` formula is unaffected, which is why this survived. The 0.3.0
  entry below took the response column out of the SVM count; what
  remained was every other column in the frame. Leaving an argument out
  takes `do.call()`, which evaluates before it builds the call, so the
  `match.call()` these backends run recorded the training frame as a
  literal: `print(model$fit)` spilled every row, and on a 960-row frame
  the stored call alone was 159 Kb of a 1.5 Mb forest. The `data`
  argument is put back to a symbol after the fit.

* The `$fit` slot was documented as the wrapped object throughout. That
  holds for a supervised method; an unsupervised one returns tidied
  components as well, so its `$fit` is the list holding them and the
  wrapped object is at `$fit$model`. Corrected in `tl_model()`, the
  README, the architecture notes, and the getting-started, unsupervised
  and integration vignettes.

* `tl_read_s3()` raised "subscript out of bounds" for a zero-length or
  multi-element `source`, the one malformed input that missed its own
  "Invalid S3 URI" message.

### Metrics and evaluation

* `tl_cv()` explains a metric that no fold could compute rather than
  leaving a bare `NaN` in the summary. `folds = nrow(data)` is
  leave-one-out, so every test fold holds one observation and `rsq` —
  which needs variation in the truth — is undefined; `mean()` over nothing
  then reported `NaN`, which reads as a malfunction rather than as a
  property of the request. `rmse` and `mae` are defined for a single
  observation and are unaffected.

* `tl_cv()` no longer repeats `tl_model()`'s notes once per fold. The note
  that a numeric response with few distinct values is being treated as
  regression is about the data, not the fold, and appeared k times.

* `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` computed precision, recall,
  sensitivity, specificity and F1 for the **wrong class**. The
  `yardstick` calls omitted `event_level`, so they defaulted to the first
  factor level while the rest of the package — AUC, class prediction,
  lift and gain — treats the second level as positive. A binary model
  predicting only positives reported specificity 1.0 where the true value
  is 0.0. Threshold metrics from `tl_evaluate_thresholds()` were affected
  the same way, so reported precision fell as the threshold rose.
  Multiclass metrics were never affected.

* `tl_cv()` never evaluated the last `n %% folds` observations: folds
  were sized with `floor(n / folds)` and sliced forward, leaving the
  remainder in every training set and no test set. On `mtcars` with
  `folds = 5`, 30 of 32 rows were scored. Rows are now assigned to folds
  so that the folds partition the data and differ in size by at most one.
  `tl_cv()` also rejects fold counts below 2 or above `nrow(data)`.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` tested linearity with
  `cor(fitted, residuals)`, which is identically zero for any OLS fit
  with an intercept — the check could only ever report SATISFIED. It is
  now a RESET-style test on powers of the fitted values.

### Fitting

* `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"` no longer fail when a predictor
  has a missing value. The response was read from `data` while the design
  matrix came from `model.frame()`, which applies `na.omit` — so a single
  missing predictor left `y` one row longer than `x`, and glmnet reported
  "number of observations in y (60) not equal to the number of rows of x
  (59)". That names neither missing values nor the column responsible, and
  reads as though the caller had passed mismatched inputs. The response is
  now taken from the same model frame that builds the design matrix, so
  these methods drop the incomplete row and carry on, as `lm()`,
  `rpart()`, `nnet()` and `svm()` already did.

### Prediction

* Classification now reduces the response to the classes it contains. A
  subset keeps every factor level, so `iris[iris$Species != "setosa", ]`
  holds two classes and declares three, and that frame broke seven of the
  eight classification methods in seven different ways: `randomForest` and
  `glmnet` refused to fit, `gbm` and `nnet` failed at `predict()` or
  `tl_evaluate()`, and `rpart` returned a probability column for the class
  that was not there. Worst of the set, `tl_calc_classification_metrics()`
  read the declared level count when deciding whether the problem was
  binary, so it stopped passing `event_level` and let `yardstick` score the
  first class as positive — silently reopening, for any such response, the
  metric defect fixed above.

  The fitted models were never wrong: `glm()` and the rest drop an empty
  level internally, so the coefficients always matched the explicitly
  dropped frame. Only tidylearn's description of them was wrong. The
  response is normalised once in `tl_model()`, so the specification, the
  fit and every predict path now agree, and metrics from a subset match
  those from `droplevels()` exactly.

* `tl_model(method = "logistic")` records a classification model when the
  response is stored as something other than a factor. A 0/1 integer
  response produced a binomial `glm()` described by a specification that
  said `is_classification = FALSE`, so `tl_evaluate()` scored it with
  `rmse`, `mae` and `rsq` — and asking it for `accuracy` returned an empty
  tibble, with no error and no warning.

* `predict()` failed or returned wrong output for six method-and-task
  combinations, all now fixed and covered by a contract test that runs
  every method through the same grid:

  * Multiclass `"boost"` returned a **single** prediction for the whole
    input, because `predict.gbm` hands back a 3-D array that
    `is.matrix()` does not recognise. `type = "prob"` errored for any
    input with more than one row.
  * `"svm"` with `type = "prob"` always errored: the fitted object
    records the flag as `$compprob`, not `$probability`.
  * Binary classification with `method = "nn"` could not fit at all —
    `entropy` was passed explicitly and collided with the value
    `nnet.formula()` supplies itself.
  * `"xgboost"` built its design matrix from the full two-sided formula,
    so scoring data without the response column was impossible.
  * `"svm"` and `"xgboost"` silently dropped rows with missing
    predictors, returning a shorter vector so that predictions no longer
    lined up with the input rows.
  * Multinomial `"ridge"`/`"lasso"`/`"elastic_net"` with `type = "prob"`
    errored on single-row input.

  The `nn` failure is worth its own note: `nnet.formula()` supplies
  `entropy = TRUE` itself when the response is a two-level factor, and
  `tl_fit_nn()` named it again, so `nnet.default()` received it twice and
  reported "formal argument 'entropy' matched by multiple actual
  arguments". Three or more classes were unaffected, because
  `nnet.formula()` uses `softmax` there and `nnet.default()` sets
  `entropy` to `FALSE` whenever `softmax` is on — so the argument it
  collided with was never present. The criterion is now left to nnet.
  Neural networks had no test coverage at all; there are now four tests
  beyond the contract grid.

* `predict()` on a `tl_auto_ml()` model fitted with engineered features no
  longer errors on raw new data. Four of the eight candidates a typical
  search produces — the `pca_*` and `clustered_*` variants — were fitted on
  columns that exist only inside the search, so predicting on a held-out set
  failed with "object 'PC1' not found" or "object 'cluster_kmeans' not
  found". Whenever one of those won the leaderboard,
  `predict(result$best_model, new_data = ...)` was unusable. Each variant now
  records the transformation that produced its features, and `predict()`
  replays it — fitted on the training data — before dispatching.

* `predict()` on a k-means model matched `new_data` to the cluster centres by
  position, taking every numeric column in whatever order it arrived.
  A mismatched width was recycled rather than rejected, producing cluster
  numbers that looked valid and were not; a reordered frame silently measured
  distance against the wrong centres. Columns are now matched by name, and a
  missing or non-numeric column is an error naming the column.

* `predict()` on a PCA model had the same defect and now aligns `new_data` to
  the training predictors by name.

* `tl_reduce_dimensions(n_components = k)` trimmed its returned data to `k`
  components but left the reduction model projecting onto all of them, so
  `predict(result$reduction_model, new_data)` returned a wider matrix than
  the model trained on `$data` could consume. The component budget is now
  recorded on the model and honoured by `predict()`.

* XGBoost prediction pins the training factor levels, so new data missing a
  level no longer changes the contrast coding, and no longer passes
  `ntreelimit` or `reshape` to `xgboost::predict()`. Both are deprecated
  upstream and warn that they will become errors; every XGBoost prediction
  emitted two warnings per call. `tl_predict_xgboost()` gains
  `iterationrange` and accepts `ntreelimit` with a deprecation warning that
  translates it. Multiclass probabilities are reshaped to one named column
  per class whichever shape the installed xgboost returns.

### Data leakage

* `tl_pipeline()` learned imputation medians and standardisation centres
  and scales from the **whole** dataset and only then split, so every
  assessment row helped define the transformation it was scored under.
  Each fold, and each side of a train/test split, now learns its own
  statistics. The final model still uses the full-data statistics, which
  `tl_predict_pipeline()` continues to replay.

* `tl_pipeline()` also imputed the **response**, replacing missing
  outcomes with the median and turning them into both training targets
  and evaluation ground truth. Imputation now skips the response.

* `tl_auto_ml()` fitted PCA rotations and cluster centroids on all rows
  before cross-validating on the transformed data, so the `pca_*` and
  `clustered_*` candidates competed against honestly scored baselines.
  Both are now refitted inside each fold, via a new `transform` argument
  to `tl_cv()`.

### Ranking, splitting and tuning

* `tl_tune_xgboost()` also refused a grid naming a single parameter.
  `expand.grid()` of one parameter is a single-column data frame, and
  `[i, ]` on one of those drops to a bare vector with the column name
  gone, so the parameters reached xgboost unnamed and it stopped with
  "parameter names cannot be empty strings". `tl_tune_grid()` and
  `tl_tune_random()` had the same slip fixed for 0.4.0; this call site
  was missed.

* `tl_tune_xgboost()` could not complete a run. It read `best_iteration`
  from the top level of the `xgb.cv()` result, which is where xgboost kept
  it before 3.0 and not where it has been since, so every parameter set
  scored `NULL`, `which.min()` over those scores returned `integer(0)`,
  and the call died on "attempt to select less than one element in
  get1index" — on the documented default call, for any input. Both
  locations are now read. Separately, `nrounds` was hardcoded at 1000
  inside the function while `...` was forwarded to the same call, so
  passing the one argument an xgboost tuner obviously takes gave "formal
  argument \"nrounds\" matched by multiple actual arguments". It is a
  named argument now, documented as the ceiling early stopping works
  within. The function had no test; it has one now.

* `tl_tune_random()` rejects a parameter range written backwards.
  `c(0.1, 0.001)` instead of `c(0.001, 0.1)` was sampled with
  `runif(1, 0.1, 0.001)`, which is `NaN` — and R only warns — so every
  iteration drew `NaN`, models were fitted with `cp = NaN`, and
  `best_params` was reported as `NaN` without anything failing. Equal
  bounds and a non-positive lower bound on a log-uniform range are
  refused for the same reason.

* `tl_tune_random()` accepts a discrete set of numbers that are not whole.
  Only whole numbers reached the discrete branch, so
  `list(cp = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1))` — the natural way to write candidate
  values for a parameter that is never an integer — was rejected as an
  "Unsupported parameter space definition", while `tl_tune_grid()` took
  the same vector without complaint.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` name a metric they cannot
  produce. Asking for `"accuracy"` on a regression task, or for a metric
  that does not exist, failed with "replacement has length zero" from the
  assignment that came up empty. The error now says which metric was
  asked for and lists what the task does produce.

* `tl_tune_deep(learning_rates = )` searched over a value that changed
  nothing. It passed `optimizer = optimizer_adam(learning_rate = )` into
  `tl_fit_deep()`, which has no such formal, so the argument fell into
  `...` and was forwarded to `keras::fit()` — by which point the model is
  compiled, and `compile()` is what sets the optimizer. Every point on the
  grid therefore trained at the same rate, and `best_learning_rate` was
  whichever happened to score highest on noise. `tl_fit_deep()` gains a
  `learning_rate` argument that reaches `compile()`, and the final refit
  on the winning configuration uses it too.

* `tl_tune_deep()` reports when no configuration could be fitted. Each fit
  is wrapped individually, so a bad argument forwarded through `...` left
  every `val_loss` as `NA`; `which.min()` then returned `integer(0)` and
  the function failed with "attempt to select less than one element in
  get1index", which describes nothing.

* `tl_auto_ml(metric = "mape")` returned the model with the **highest**
  error as the best one — `mape` was missing from the ascending-sort
  list. Unrecognised metrics now error rather than assume a direction.
  `tl_auto_ml()` also returns `best_model_name`.

* `tl_split()` could return an empty training set *and* an empty test
  set: `floor(n * prop)` can be zero, and `data[-integer(0), ]` selects
  nothing. Every group now keeps at least one row on each side.

* `tl_tune_random()` ignored two documented parameter forms. Any
  two-element numeric was caught by the continuous branch first, so an
  integer range like `c(100, 500)` was sampled with `runif()`; and the
  log-uniform form `c(min, max, "log")` is a character vector, so its
  branch was unreachable and the literal `"log"` could be sampled as a
  value. `param_space` is now fully documented.

* `tl_pipeline()` accepted a partial `preprocessing` or `evaluation` list and
  then failed inside `tl_run_pipeline()` with "argument is of length zero".
  Both specifications now fill in their defaults for anything unnamed. An
  unrecognised name is an error rather than a step that silently does
  nothing, and `evaluation$best_metric` is checked against
  `evaluation$metrics`.

### Diagnostics

* `tl_check_assumptions()`, `tl_influence_measures()` and
  `tl_diagnostic_dashboard()` no longer fail when a predictor has a
  missing value. `lm()` drops incomplete cases, so `residuals()`,
  `fitted()` and every influence measure came back shorter than
  `model$data`, and combining them raised "arguments imply differing
  number of rows: 60, 59" — which describes nothing the caller did.

* `tl_influence_measures()` numbers observations by their row in the
  training data. It used `1:n`, so after a dropped row every observation
  was attributed to its neighbour: with row 3 missing, what the table
  called observation 3 was row 4, and so on to the end.

* `optimal_hclust_k(method = "gap")` never ran. `cluster::clusGap()`
  requires its clustering function to return a list with a `cluster`
  element and `cutree()` returns a bare integer vector, so every call
  failed with "$ operator is invalid for atomic vectors". Two further
  faults sat behind that one and could not show themselves while it
  errored on the first call: the refit used `stats::dist()`, whose default
  is Euclidean, so a model built with any other distance was scored
  against clusterings it would never produce; and a model built from a
  `dist` object has no observations to resample, which surfaced as "no
  applicable method for 'select' applied to an object of class NULL"
  rather than as an explanation. All three are fixed, and the last is now
  an error that says to refit from the data or use `"silhouette"`, which
  works from distances alone.

* `tidy_dbscan()` converted a `dist` input with `as.matrix()` and passed
  it as coordinates, clustering each observation's vector of distances
  rather than the dissimilarity. It also read a non-existent `"core"`
  attribute, so every point was reported as a non-core point.

* `tidy_kmeans()` lost its entire metrics tibble for the Lloyd, Forgy and
  MacQueen algorithms, which leave `ifault` NULL.

* `tidy_gower()` documented `weights` as a named vector but indexed it
  positionally, applying weights to the wrong variables. Named weights
  are now matched by name, and a mismatched length errors.

* `tidy_mds(method = "sammon")` and `method = "kruskal"` passed MASS's
  "zero or negative distance between objects i and j" straight through. The
  cause is duplicated rows, which the message does not say. Both now check
  first and name the offending pairs.

* `tl_plot_cv_results()` could not plot `tl_cv()` output — it read
  `$fold_metrics` and `mean_value`, which are named `$folds` and `mean`.

* Lift and gain charts indexed past the end of the data in their final
  deciles, corrupting the cumulative curve.

* The outlier plot from `tl_detect_outliers()` attached flags to the
  wrong observations whenever more than one variable was plotted.

* `plot_distance_heatmap()` sorted its axes alphabetically, moving the
  diagonal off the diagonal and discarding any `cluster_order`.

* Influence plots used unnamed colour vectors, so when every point was
  influential they all rendered in the "not influential" colour.

* `tl_plot_nn_architecture()` failed on any neural network with a single
  output unit — every regression fit, and every two-class fit once those
  could be fitted at all. `NeuralNetTools::plotnet()` evaluates
  `mod_in$call$formula` on that branch, and `nnet()` records its call
  verbatim, so what it found was the symbol `formula` resolving to
  `stats::formula`: "cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type
  'character'". `tl_fit_nn()` now substitutes the formula into the recorded
  call. Multiclass took the other branch, which is why the function's own
  example passed.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "parallel")` and
  `tl_plot_regularization_path()` used the `size` aesthetic on a line, which
  ggplot2 deprecated in 3.4.0 and which told the user to file a bug against
  tidylearn. Both use `linewidth`.

* `tidy_pca_biplot(color_by = )` and `plot_mds(color_by = )` accepted only a
  column name, but the tibbles they draw from carry an identifier and the
  coordinates — there is nowhere for a grouping variable to live, so the
  documented use was unreachable. Both now also accept a vector as long as
  the data, and a name that cannot resolve is an error rather than a plot
  that fails when printed.

* `tl_interaction_effects()` emitted "essentially perfect fit" warnings from
  `summary.lm()`. The slope is estimated by regressing the model's own fitted
  values on the grid, which for a linear model lie exactly on a line, so the
  warning was expected by construction and is no longer passed on. The
  documentation now says that `slopes$slope_se` describes the fit to the
  prediction grid rather than the uncertainty of the marginal effect.

### Data ingestion

* `tl_read_kaggle()` no longer lets a dataset slug reach the shell as
  written. The slug was interpolated into `system2()`, which applies
  `shQuote()` to the command and leaves the arguments alone, and
  `tl_parse_kaggle_url()` matched `[^/]+/[^/]+$` — which admits `;`, `|`,
  backticks and `$(`. The URL parser is also skipped entirely when the
  caller passes a bare string, so the slug was not necessarily anything
  Kaggle produced. A pasted dataset link was the vector. Slugs and file
  names are now validated against what Kaggle identifiers actually are,
  before interpolation and before the CLI is looked for, and
  caller-derived values are quoted — which also fixes a destination path
  containing spaces.

* `tl_read_kaggle(file = NULL)` downloaded into a shared `tempdir()` and
  returned the newest matching data file, so a file left by an earlier
  call could be handed back as the requested dataset. Each download now
  gets its own directory, emptied first.

* `tl_read_kaggle(type = "competition")` returned no data. Competition
  downloads arrive zipped and that endpoint has no `--unzip` flag, so the
  search for a data file found none. Archives are unpacked first, and the
  search recurses.

* `tl_read_zip(format = )` forced one format onto every member. A zip
  holding a CSV and a JSON read the JSON as CSV and row-bound the result,
  producing a frame with a column named after the JSON's first line and no
  error at all. When the archive holds more than one kind of data file,
  `format` now selects the members of that format.

### Errors instead of misleading results

* Unsupervised routines that cannot use missing values now say so, naming
  the columns and how many values are affected. `tidy_kmeans()` and
  `tidy_gap_stat()` previously surfaced `stats::kmeans()`'s "NA/NaN/Inf in
  foreign function call (arg 1)", `tidy_pca()` gave `prcomp()`'s "infinite
  or missing values in 'x'", and `calc_wss()`, `optimal_clusters()` and
  `tidy_silhouette_analysis()` loop over k with `purrr`, which wrapped
  those again into "In index: 2. Caused by error in `do_one()`". None of
  them named the column, the problem, or a way forward. Missing values are
  the most ordinary thing that can be wrong with a data set.

  The message points at `"pam"` and `"clara"`, which accept missing values.
  Those, along with `tidy_dist()`, `tidy_gower()`, `tidy_mds()` and
  `tidy_hclust()`, are unchanged — they handle missing values themselves,
  and guarding them would remove working behaviour rather than improve a
  message.

* `tl_split()` and `tl_tune_random()` no longer rewrite the session's
  random stream. Both called `set.seed()` when given a `seed`, so a
  function seeded for its own reproducibility was also deciding what every
  later `sample()` or `rnorm()` in the caller's script returned — two
  scripts differing only in whether they passed `seed` diverged everywhere
  downstream. The stream is restored on exit; the seed still does its own
  job.

* `tidy_pca(method = "princomp")` produced loadings that could not be
  used. `princomp()` returns a `"loadings"` object rather than a plain
  matrix, and `tibble::as_tibble()` read that as a single long vector — 16
  values against 4 row names for a four-variable PCA — so
  `get_pca_loadings()` failed with "Can't recycle `..1` (size 16) to match
  `..3` (size 4)". The loadings now match `prcomp()`'s, up to the sign
  convention.

* The method and the response now have to agree. `"linear"` and
  `"polynomial"` need a numeric response and `"logistic"` needs exactly two
  classes; every other supervised method takes either. A mismatch is an
  error at `tl_model()`, naming the methods that would fit.

  `tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "linear")` previously succeeded.
  `lm()` estimates from a factor's underlying integer codes — its
  coefficients are identical to regressing on `as.integer(Species)` — so
  the classes were treated as equally spaced points on a scale and
  `predict()` returned numbers between them. Nothing failed at any stage,
  which made this quieter than the logistic case: there was no later error
  to work back from.

  In the other direction, `tl_model(mtcars, mpg ~ wt, method = "logistic")`
  reported that `mpg` "has 25 levels", listed all of them, and recommended
  classification methods for what is plainly a regression problem. It now
  says the response is numeric with 25 distinct values and points at the
  regression methods, while still accepting a two-class response stored as
  0/1.

* `tl_model(method = "logistic")` now errors when the response does not have
  exactly two levels. `glm(family = binomial)` accepts a three-level factor
  without complaint and fits the first level against the other two, so
  `tl_model(iris, Species ~ ., method = "logistic")` returned a model that
  looked fine and meant nothing. The failure surfaced three calls later, at
  `predict(type = "class")` and `tl_evaluate()`, both of which reported only
  that multiclass logistic was "not implemented" — by which point the caller
  had no reason to suspect the method choice. The error is now raised at fit
  time and names the methods that do handle more than two classes. A
  single-level response is reported separately.

  `tl_pipeline()` offered `logistic` as a default candidate for any
  classification task, so without a matching guard a three-level response
  would now fail the whole pipeline rather than one model. It offers
  `logistic` only for a two-level response, as `tl_auto_ml()` already did.

* `tl_semisupervised()`, `tl_anomaly_aware()`, `tl_transfer_learning()` and
  `tl_stratified_models()` default to `supervised_method = "tree"`. The first
  three defaulted to `"logistic"`, which cannot fit a response with more than
  two levels or a numeric one, and the fourth to `"linear"`, which fits
  `lm()` to a factor response and returns numbers rather than refusing.
  `tl_anomaly_aware(iris, Species ~ ., response = "Species")` — the function's
  own documented example — was in the first group. `"tree"` handles
  regression and classification, at any number of classes.

  This changes the model a call produces when `supervised_method` is not
  given. Pass it explicitly to keep the previous behaviour.

* `tl_check_assumptions()` and `tl_influence_measures()` advertised
  support for `"ridge"`, `"lasso"` and `"elastic_net"`, but glmnet
  provides no residuals, hat values or influence measures. They now
  explain this instead of failing partway through.

* `plot_cluster_comparison()` and `create_cluster_dashboard()` called
  `gridExtra` without a `requireNamespace()` guard.

* Database connection strings carried the password into the returned
  object's `tl_source` attribute — printed on every `print()` and
  persisted by `saveRDS()` — into the progress message, and into the
  URL parse error. All are now redacted.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results()` names the valid `plot_type` values in its error
  instead of reporting "Invalid plot_type or insufficient parameters".

* `get_pca_variance()` and `get_pca_loadings()` accept a PCA model from
  `tl_model(method = "pca")` as well as a `tidy_pca()` object. The two
  representations carry the same tables under different names, and the
  accessors previously took only one of them.

* `inst/examples/unified_workflow.R` reported "Reduced from 4 to 2 features"
  after requesting three components, and passed `supervised_method =
  "logistic"` on three-class iris in three places, producing convergence
  warnings. It is now exercised by `tests/testthat/test-examples.R`, so it
  cannot drift again unnoticed.

## Documentation

* Every exported function now carries a runnable example. Thirteen had
  none: `tl_predict_pipeline()`, `tl_compare_pipeline_models()`,
  `tl_plot_cv_results()`, `tl_interaction_effects()`,
  `tl_plot_interaction()`, `tl_tune_nn()`, `tl_plot_nn_tuning()`,
  `tl_tune_xgboost()`, `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()`,
  `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_dependence()` and the three `print` methods.
  Writing them is what surfaced the `tl_tune_xgboost()` defects above.

* `tl_plot_nn_tuning()` documented the wrong input and the wrong plot. It
  takes the list `tl_tune_nn()` returns rather than a fitted model — the
  error message said so, the `@param` did not — and it draws a heatmap of
  the size-by-decay grid, not the training history its title claimed.

* `DiagrammeR` is now declared in Suggests. `tl_plot_xgboost_tree()`
  cannot render without it, reaching it through `xgboost::xgb.plot.tree()`.

* Corrected five factual errors across the docs: the README claimed ten
  articles where there are eleven; `compute-backends` said eleven CPU-only
  methods and then listed ten, omitting `"polynomial"`;
  `integration-workflows` still documented `tl_semisupervised()` as
  defaulting to `supervised_method = "logistic"` after it changed to
  `"tree"`; `tuning-and-pipelines` wrote 6 x 3 = 19 fits; and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` gave its versioning worked example against 0.3.0,
  telling contributors to open a NEWS heading a release out of date.

* Rewrote `integration-workflows` and `reporting`, which had drifted from
  the register of the other nine articles. Their generic "Best Practices"
  and "Summary" sections are gone, each function now gets a sentence on
  what it buys you and what it costs, and the train-then-replay rule that
  governs all five integration functions is stated once up front rather
  than only in code comments.

* Removed duplicated prose. The overview blurb, the "what tidylearn is /
  is NOT" bullets and the principles list each existed verbatim in two or
  three of README, `getting-started` and `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`;
  `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md` now links to the README for all three, the way
  it already did for the method-to-package table. `getting-started` and
  `supervised-learning` no longer close with a summary restating their own
  introductions.

* New vignette `compute-backends`: how `compute = "auto"` routes a fit, what
  the advisor estimates a cloud tier would cost, and the safety model that
  governs data egress.

* New vignette `market-basket`: the association rules family
  (`tidy_apriori()`, `inspect_rules()`, `filter_rules_by_item()`,
  `find_related_items()`, `recommend_products()`, `summarize_rules()`,
  `visualize_rules()`) had no narrative documentation.

* New vignette `tuning-and-pipelines`: `tl_tune_grid()`, `tl_tune_random()`,
  `tl_default_param_grid()`, `tl_plot_tuning_results()` and the
  `tl_pipeline()` family, none of which were covered.

* New vignette `diagnostics`: `tl_check_assumptions()`,
  `tl_influence_measures()`, `tl_detect_outliers()`,
  `tl_diagnostic_dashboard()`, `tl_compare_cv()`,
  `tl_test_model_difference()`, `tl_test_interactions()`,
  `tl_interaction_effects()` and `tl_explore()`.

* `unsupervised-learning` rewritten to use the package's own `tidy_*()` and
  `augment_*()` interface. It previously reached into `model$fit$clusters`,
  `$fit$centers`, `$fit$loadings` and `$fit$variance_explained` throughout,
  and hand-rolled an elbow search, while `optimal_clusters()`,
  `plot_elbow()`, `plot_silhouette()`, `suggest_eps()` and
  `explore_dbscan_params()` went unmentioned.

* `automl` now executes. Twenty-three of its twenty-five chunks were
  `eval = FALSE`, with hand-written `#>` lines that read as console output
  and were not. The budget-tier table of predicted model counts is replaced
  by a sweep that measures them.

* `integration-workflows` no longer emits 135 recycling warnings from the
  PCA-then-cluster workflow, and its reported accuracy is no longer computed
  from mis-assigned clusters.

* `supervised-learning` seeds the missing-values example, which was
  unreproducible across builds.

* README links the documentation site and every article; `inst/CITATION`
  reports the installed version and year rather than a hard-coded 2025.

* `inst/security/threat-model.md` is rewritten for the architecture the
  transport spike settled on: plain HTTPS to a Modal Web Function backed by
  an R worker, rather than reticulate driving the Python SDK. T1 and T4
  named constraints that no longer apply, and no threat covered a
  user-supplied endpoint URL.

## Internal

* Removed four internal helpers with no callers: `create_obs_ids()`,
  `extract_response()`, `get_numeric_cols()` and `validate_data()`. They had
  survived two reviews on the grounds that they looked like intentional
  utilities.

* `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` builds on pull requests without deploying,
  so a dangling article name fails a PR check rather than the first push to
  main, and deploys with `clean: true` so removed pages leave the live site.


# tidylearn 0.4.0

## New Features

### Compute backends (foundation)

* `tl_check_gpu()` — detects local NVIDIA CUDA support and reports which
  GPU-capable backends (xgboost, keras, tensorflow, torch) are
  installed. Cheap detection: parses `nvidia-smi` output and checks
  installed packages without loading Python or fitting a model. Returns
  a `tidylearn_gpu_check` object with a `print()` method.

* `tl_compute_advisor()` — S3 generic that estimates runtime, peak RAM,
  and cost across local CPU, local GPU, and cloud GPU tiers for a given
  tidylearn method and dataset. Dispatches on either a method name
  (`character`) or a fitted `tidylearn_supervised` model. Returns a
  structured recommendation with a `print()` method. Cloud-tier
  estimates are reported but not yet executable; Modal integration will
  follow in a later iteration.

### Compute backends (local GPU routing)

* `tl_model()` now accepts a `compute` argument on both supervised and
  unsupervised paths: `"cpu"` (default — existing behaviour), `"gpu"`
  (route to local CUDA when the method supports it), `"auto"` (consult
  `tl_compute_advisor()` and pick per call), or `"cloud"` (reserved;
  errors with a clear message until the Modal integration lands).

* `tl_fit_xgboost(compute = "gpu")` passes `device = "cuda"` to
  `xgb.train()`. Requires xgboost compiled with CUDA support.

* `tl_fit_deep(compute = "gpu")` defers to TensorFlow's automatic CUDA
  detection — the argument is accepted for API consistency but does not
  itself change the keras model setup.

* All compute validation flows through `tl_resolve_compute()` so the
  behaviour is uniform across paradigms: methods without an upstream
  GPU path (linear, glm, randomForest, pca, kmeans, etc.) warn and fall
  back to CPU when `"gpu"` is requested; `"cloud"` errors the same way
  on supervised and unsupervised methods. The resolved tier is recorded
  on `model$spec$compute` for both paradigms.

### Compute backends (cloud reframed as memory-headroom tier)

* `tl_compute_advisor()` now treats cloud as a "doesn't fit on my
  machine" tier rather than a GPU-acceleration-only tier. Cloud
  estimates are produced for every method the advisor supports (not
  just GPU-eligible ones), and the recommendation flips to `"cloud"`
  whenever the local job is RAM-infeasible — including CPU-only
  methods like linear regression, SVM or random forest on very large
  data.

  Scope: the advisor covers the 13 supervised methods in
  `.tl_method_profiles`. Unsupervised methods (PCA, k-means, MDS,
  clustering) are not modelled and calling the advisor on one errors.
  Reaching the cloud recommendation through `tl_model(compute =
  "auto")` additionally requires a method with an upstream GPU path
  (`xgboost`, `deep`), since `tl_resolve_compute()` short-circuits
  CPU-only methods to `"cpu"` before consulting the advisor. Call
  `tl_compute_advisor()` directly to get memory-headroom advice for the
  other supervised methods.

* New internal Modal instance tier table (`.tl_modal_tiers`) listing
  CPU-RAM tiers (`cpu-small`, `cpu-large`, `cpu-xlarge`) alongside GPU
  tiers (`t4`, `a10g`, `a100-40gb`, `a100-80gb`). The advisor picks the
  cheapest viable tier for the workload based on RAM headroom and
  whether the method has an upstream GPU path. Pricing is approximate
  as of early 2026 and may drift; revise if Modal pricing changes.

* The advisor's recommendation is no longer gated on
  `cloud$configured`. The advisor advises optimally; the caller
  (`tl_resolve_compute()`) decides whether it can act on a cloud
  recommendation. When `compute = "auto"` and the advisor recommends
  cloud, `tl_resolve_compute()` emits a clear message that cloud isn't
  yet wired up and falls back to local CPU.

* Print method updated: the cloud line now shows the chosen tier label
  (e.g., `T4 (16 GB VRAM / 16 GB RAM)`) alongside the time and cost
  estimate.

### Compute backends (security threat model)

* Added `inst/security/threat-model.md` — the contract for what
  cloud compute in tidylearn will and will not do once the Modal
  integration lands. Covers token handling (never read in R), data
  egress consent (per-call `confirm_upload = TRUE` plus session-level
  `tl_cloud_consent()`), ephemeral compute (no persistent Modal
  volumes by default), no telemetry, and an audit checklist that
  reviewers can grep / verify against the Modal-integration PR. The
  doc is shipped with the package so users (and CRAN reviewers) can
  find it via `system.file("security/threat-model.md", package =
  "tidylearn")`.

## Bug Fixes

These four defects produced plausible but wrong numbers rather than
errors, so results computed with earlier versions should be rechecked.

* `tl_evaluate()` scored classification models against raw prediction
  output rather than class labels. Because the default `predict()` type
  returns probabilities for logistic regression, comparing them to
  factor labels gave an accuracy of exactly 0 for every logistic model.
  Evaluation now requests `type = "class"` explicitly. Everything built
  on `tl_evaluate()` was affected — `tl_cv()`, `tl_tune_grid()`,
  `tl_tune_random()`, `tl_run_pipeline()`, `tl_auto_ml()` and
  `tl_compare_cv()` all ranked logistic models last regardless of how
  they actually performed.

* `tl_evaluate()` had no `metrics` argument, so a requested metric
  silently landed in `...` and was forwarded to `predict()`. Only
  accuracy (classification) or rmse/mae/rsq (regression) were ever
  returned. `tl_evaluate()` now takes `metrics` and computes the
  requested set, delegating to `tl_calc_classification_metrics()` for
  classification. Classification supports accuracy, precision, recall,
  sensitivity, specificity, f1, auc and pr_auc; regression supports
  rmse, mse, mae, mape and rsq. `tl_cv()` gains a matching `metrics`
  argument. This removes the "Could not determine best model ... all
  values NA" warning from default pipeline runs and the
  `replacement has length zero` error from
  `tl_tune_grid(metric = "f1")`.

  Regression `rsq` is now `1 - SS_res/SS_tot` rather than the squared
  correlation. The two agree for in-sample OLS; the squared correlation
  was optimistic on held-out data.

* `tl_predict_pipeline()` derived its centre and scale from
  `results$processed_data`, which is stored *after* standardization —
  so new data was rescaled against a mean of ~0 and an sd of ~1 and
  reached the model in raw units. On `mtcars` with `mpg ~ wt + hp` this
  returned predictions near -230 for rows whose actual mpg was 21. The
  same defect made imputation substitute a standardized median (~0) for
  missing values instead of the raw-scale one. `tl_run_pipeline()` now
  records the medians, modes, centres and scales it learned in
  `results$preprocessing_stats`, and `tl_predict_pipeline()` applies
  those. Pipelines run by an earlier version carry no such statistics
  and now raise a clear error asking for a re-run rather than silently
  producing wrong predictions. Constant columns are centred without
  dividing by zero.

* `tl_auto_ml()`'s leaderboard scores were always `NA`.
  `create_leaderboard()` expected a result shape that neither
  `tl_cv()` nor `tl_evaluate()` produces, so every model scored `NA`
  and the reported "best model" was whichever trained first. Score
  extraction now handles both shapes, and the target metric is passed
  through to every evaluation.

* `predict()` on unsupervised models used `nrow(new_data) ==
  nrow(object$data)` to decide whether new data had been supplied. Any
  new data with the same number of rows as the training set silently
  got the training result back — verified with a PCA projection of an
  all-999 frame returning the training scores. `predict()` now tracks
  whether the caller supplied `new_data` rather than inferring it from
  row count. This also affected `predict.tidylearn_transfer()` and
  `predict.tidylearn_stratified()`, which delegate to it.

  Methods with no out-of-sample projection (PAM, CLARA, MDS, DBSCAN,
  hierarchical clustering) now error when handed new data instead of
  returning training assignments that look like predictions. PAM and
  CLARA gained the training-data branch they previously lacked, and
  hierarchical clustering — whose fit holds a tree, not assignments —
  points at `tidy_cutree()` rather than returning `NULL`.

* Prediction for `ridge`, `lasso` and `elastic_net` built its design
  matrix from a `~ predictors - 1` formula while the fit used
  `model.matrix()` with the intercept dropped. The two disagree
  whenever a factor predictor is present: the fit uses treatment
  contrasts (k-1 columns), prediction one-hot encodes (k columns), so
  any such model failed with `The number of variables in newx must be
  N`. The fit now records its terms and factor levels, and prediction
  rebuilds an identically-coded design matrix from them.

* Regularized classification ignored the `type` argument and always
  returned class labels, so `type = "prob"` gave labels and ROC,
  calibration, lift and gain plots could not work for these models.
  `type = "prob"` now returns one probability column per class (binary
  and multinomial), and `type = "class"`/`"response"` returns a factor
  carrying the training levels rather than a character vector. An
  unrecognised type errors instead of silently returning labels.

* `method = "boost"` could not fit a classification model at all:
  `gbm()` was handed a factor response with `distribution =
  "bernoulli"`, which requires a numeric 0/1 response. The response is
  now encoded with the second factor level as the positive class,
  matching the orientation `tl_predict_boost()` already assumed.

* `plot()` failed for every unsupervised method. The `tl_fit_*`
  wrappers unpack the `tidy_*` objects into plain lists, but the plot
  helpers were handed the unpacked list: k-means, PAM, CLARA and
  DBSCAN partial-matched `$cluster` to the `$clusters` tibble and built
  a nested column; PCA and MDS hit `tidy_pca`/`tidy_mds` class checks
  that a plain list cannot satisfy; hclust passed a list where an
  `hclust` object was expected. Each method now supplies the structure
  its plot helper expects.

### Compute backends (corrections)

* `parallel` is now declared in Imports. `tl_estimate_local_cpu_internal()`
  calls `parallel::detectCores()`, which without the declaration produces
  an "'::' call not declared from" NOTE under `R CMD check`.

* `testthat` minimum raised to 3.1.7. The compute tests use
  `local_mocked_bindings()` (3.1.7) and `expect_no_warning()` (3.1.5);
  on an older testthat the suite errored rather than skipped.

* `tl_detect_cuda_internal()` now checks the exit status of `nvidia-smi`.
  A machine with the binary installed but the driver unloaded prints its
  error message to stdout and exits non-zero — that text was being parsed
  as a device name, so `tl_check_gpu()` reported a working GPU and
  `compute = "gpu"` routed `device = "cuda"` into a fit that then failed.

* GPU routing for xgboost now requires xgboost >= 2.0.0, checked during
  backend detection. The `device` parameter arrived in 2.0.0; older
  versions ignore unknown parameters, so the fit ran on CPU while
  `spec$compute` recorded `"gpu"`. Older versions are now reported as
  having no GPU path, so `compute = "gpu"` warns and falls back honestly.

* `tl_model(compute = "auto")` now forwards the caller's runtime-relevant
  hyperparameters to the advisor. Previously the advisor always estimated
  a default-sized job, so `tl_model(..., method = "xgboost", nrounds =
  5000, compute = "auto")` was costed as `nrounds = 100` and could choose
  CPU when GPU was the right call.

* `tl_compute_advisor()` no longer skips a local GPU that finishes
  quickly. The guard required an estimated GPU runtime of at least 5
  seconds on top of a 3x speedup, so a job estimated at 70s on CPU and
  4.7s on GPU — a 15x speedup — was reported as "No meaningfully faster
  tier available". The sub-60s check earlier in the same function
  already covers jobs too small to bother offloading.

* `tl_compute_advisor(fitted_model, formula = ...)` no longer errors with
  "formal argument 'formula' matched by multiple actual arguments". The
  documentation says `formula` is ignored for a fitted model; now it
  actually is.

## Other Changes

* `tl_auto_ml()` now cross-validates the PCA-augmented and
  cluster-augmented variants when the budget allows. Previously these
  were scored on training data while baselines were cross-validated, so
  once scoring worked at all, overfit variants would have outranked
  honestly-scored models. The leaderboard gains an `evaluation` column
  recording `"cv"` or `"train"` per model, since mixed scores are not
  directly comparable.

* `tl_auto_ml()` no longer fits logistic regression to a multiclass
  response — the implementation is binary-only, and the resulting model
  was meaningless. It errors early when the response has fewer than two
  observed classes.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` rejects an unnamed `models` argument. Passing a
  character vector previously trained nothing and failed later with an
  indexing error.

* `tl_evaluate()` errors when the response column is absent from
  `new_data` instead of computing metrics against `NULL`.

* `tl_tune_grid()` and `tl_tune_random()` failed with "argument is of
  length zero" whenever a `metric` was named without also naming
  `maximize`. The optimisation direction was only assigned inside the
  branch that supplies a default metric, so an explicit metric left
  `maximize` at `NULL` and the later `if (maximize)` errored. Direction
  now follows the metric itself: `rmse`, `mse`, `mae` and `mape` are
  minimised, everything else maximised. An explicitly supplied
  `maximize` is still respected.

* Tuning a single hyperparameter dropped its name. Indexing one column
  of the results without `drop = FALSE` collapsed the row to a bare
  value, so the winning setting was passed to `tl_model()` positionally
  and never reached the underlying fit — a tuned `cp` or `lambda` was
  silently discarded. Affected both `tl_tune_grid()` and
  `tl_tune_random()`.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "importance")` errored on
  categorical parameters with "Can't subset `.data` outside of a data
  mask context". The ANOVA branch built its formula with the tidy-eval
  `.data` pronoun, which `aov()` cannot evaluate; it now uses
  `stats::reformulate()`.

* `tl_plot_tuning_results(plot_type = "grid")` errored with "object 'p'
  not found" when a parameter had more than 20 unique values. The
  fallback to a scatter plot called the function recursively but
  discarded the result.

## Tests

* New `test-metrics.R` and `test-pipeline.R` cover the four fixes
  above; `tl_evaluate()` and the whole pipeline family previously had
  no test coverage, which is why the defects survived. Added
  leaderboard scoring and ranking tests to `test-workflows.R`.

* `tl_auto_ml handles small datasets` used `iris[1:30, ]`, which is
  entirely setosa. It passed only because a degenerate single-class
  logistic model was counted as a trained model. It now samples across
  all three species, and a separate test covers the single-class
  rejection.

* New `test-supervised-predict.R` and `test-unsupervised-predict.R`
  cover the prediction fixes above, and `tests/testthat/setup.R` draws
  base-graphics test plots to a null device so they no longer leave an
  `Rplots.pdf` behind.

## Documentation

* Corrected vignette examples that printed wrong results. The
  integration-workflows vignette reported 0% accuracy in five places —
  it compared logistic regression's probability output against factor
  labels, on a three-class response that logistic regression cannot
  represent. The supervised-learning vignette reported 33.3% (chance)
  for its complete-workflow example, which fitted on standardized
  features and then predicted on raw test data. Both now use
  multiclass-capable methods, score through `tl_evaluate()`, and apply
  the training preprocessing to the test set.

* The getting-started and supervised-learning vignettes now explain
  that `predict()`'s default `type = "response"` returns probabilities
  for logistic regression but class labels for trees and forests, and
  show `type = "class"` and `type = "prob"` alongside `tl_evaluate()`.

* Re-enabled seven vignette chunks that were disabled while the
  underlying bugs were present: ridge, lasso, elastic net and SVM in
  the supervised-learning vignette, and PAM, DBSCAN and CLARA in the
  unsupervised-learning vignette.

* Added package-level documentation, so `?tidylearn` now resolves.

* README: fixed a `predict()` example that referenced columns which do
  not exist, replaced a `plot_clusters()` call that passed a model
  where a data frame is required, and added a section on the compute
  backends.

* `tl_run_pipeline()` documents the `$preprocessing_stats` component,
  and `predict()` no longer advertises unsupervised `type` values that
  it ignores — its `@return` now describes the shape unsupervised
  models actually produce, and which of them accept `new_data`.

* `tl_check_gpu()` and `tl_compute_advisor()` examples now run rather
  than sitting in `\dontrun{}`; neither requires a GPU.

# tidylearn 0.3.1

## Performance

* `tidy_gower()` — eliminated two layers of redundant work in the pairwise
  distance loop:
  * Column ranges (`max - min`) and ordinal rank vectors were previously
    recomputed on every `(i, j)` pair. They are now computed once in a
    pre-pass, reducing work from O(n² × p) to O(n² + p).
  * Replaced scalar data-frame indexing `data[i, k]` — which dispatches to
    the R-level `[.data.frame` method on every call — with pre-extracted
    plain-vector access `col_vecs[[k]][i]`, which resolves at the C level.
    Benchmarks show 10–100× faster scalar access; the gain compounds across
    the full `n*(n-1)/2 * p` iterations.
  * Column types (`is.numeric`, `is.ordered`) are now resolved once into a
    `col_type` character vector, removing repeated S3 predicate calls from
    the inner loop.

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `tl_reduce_dimensions()` returning the internal `.obs_id` row
  identifier as a column of its `$data` result. Passing that data to a
  supervised model via a `response ~ .` formula fed `.obs_id` in as a
  high-cardinality predictor, which made tree-based fits effectively
  non-terminating. The identifier is now dropped from the returned data,
  consistent with how the pipeline and transfer-learning paths already
  handle it.
* Fixed `print()` and `summary()` erroring on the model objects returned
  by `tl_step_selection()` and `tl_tune_xgboost()`. Both constructed their
  object without the `spec$paradigm` field or the `tidylearn_supervised`
  class, so the print method hit a zero-length `if` condition and
  `summary()` took the unsupervised branch. Both objects are now built
  consistently with `tl_model()`.
* Fixed `tidy_gower()` (and `tidy_dist(..., method = "gower")`) erroring on
  single-row input. The pairwise loop used `1:(n - 1)`, which produces the
  invalid sequence `1:0` when `n` is 1; it now uses `seq_len(n - 1)`, so a
  single-row data frame returns an empty `dist` object, consistent with
  `stats::dist()`.

## Tests

* Added 11 tests for `tidy_gower()` / `tidy_dist(..., method = "gower")`
  covering: return type and metadata, symmetry and self-distance, identical
  rows, hand-verified numeric / categorical / ordered / mixed-type distances,
  NA skipping, custom weights, constant-column denominator behaviour, and
  single-row input.

## Internal

* Removed seven unused packages from `Suggests` (caret, mclust, onnx,
  parsnip, recipes, reticulate, workflows) — none were referenced in
  package code, tests, or vignettes.


# tidylearn 0.3.0

## New Features

### Data Ingestion (`tl_read()` Family)

* New `tl_read()` dispatcher function — auto-detects format from file
  extension, URL pattern, or connection string and routes to the appropriate
  reader
* All readers return a `tidylearn_data` object, a tibble subclass carrying
  source, format, and timestamp metadata via `print.tidylearn_data()`

#### File Format Readers

* `tl_read_csv()` / `tl_read_tsv()` — via readr with base R fallback
* `tl_read_excel()` — `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` files via readxl
* `tl_read_parquet()` — via nanoparquet
* `tl_read_json()` — tabular JSON via jsonlite
* `tl_read_rds()` / `tl_read_rdata()` — native R formats via base R

#### Database Readers

* `tl_read_db()` — query any live DBI connection
* `tl_read_sqlite()` — auto-connect to SQLite files via RSQLite
* `tl_read_postgres()` — connection string or named params via RPostgres
* `tl_read_mysql()` — connection string or named params via RMariaDB
* `tl_read_bigquery()` — Google BigQuery via bigrquery

#### Cloud/API Readers

* `tl_read_s3()` — download and read from S3 URIs via paws.storage
* `tl_read_github()` — download raw files from GitHub repositories
* `tl_read_kaggle()` — download datasets via the Kaggle CLI

#### Multi-File Reading

* `tl_read()` accepts a character vector of paths — reads each and row-binds
  with a `source_file` column
* `tl_read_dir()` — scan a directory for data files with optional format,
  pattern, and recursive filtering
* `tl_read_zip()` — extract and read from zip archives, with optional file
  selection
* All backend packages are suggested dependencies, checked at call time via
  `tl_check_packages()`

### New Vignette

* Added "Data Ingestion with tidylearn" vignette covering all readers,
  databases, cloud sources, multi-file reading, and the full pipeline
* Updated "Getting Started" vignette to include `tl_read()` in the workflow

## Bug Fixes

### Workflow and Pipeline Fixes

* Fixed `tl_transfer_learning()` hanging indefinitely when used with PCA
  pre-training. The `.obs_id` row-identifier column from PCA output was
  being included in the supervised formula, creating a massive dummy-variable
  matrix. The column is now stripped before both training and prediction.
* Fixed `tl_run_pipeline()` failing with "attempt to select less than one
  element" when all cross-validation metrics were NA. Root cause: `scale()`
  returned matrix columns instead of vectors, causing downstream metric
  computation to produce NaN. Added `as.vector()` wrapper and hardened the
  best-model selection to handle all-NA metric values gracefully.
* Overhauled `tl_auto_ml()` time budget enforcement. The budget now controls
  which models are attempted: budgets under 30s skip slow C-level models
  (forest, SVM, XGBoost) entirely, and cross-validation is skipped when
  remaining time is tight. Baseline model order changed to fast-first
  (tree, logistic/linear, then forest). See `?tl_auto_ml` for full details
  on budget tiers.

### Interaction and Prediction Fixes

* Fixed `tl_interaction_effects()` crashing with "unused argument (se.fit)"
  because tidylearn's `predict()` method does not support `se.fit`. Now uses
  `stats::predict()` on the raw model object for confidence intervals. Also
  fixed an invalid formula in the internal slope calculation.
* Fixed `tl_plot_interaction()` expecting `fit`/`lwr`/`upr` columns from
  `predict()` output. Now correctly handles tidylearn's `.pred` tibble
  format.

### Visualization Fixes

* Fixed `tl_plot_intervals()` calling non-existent `tl_prediction_intervals()`
  function. Now computes confidence and prediction intervals directly via
  `stats::predict(..., interval = "confidence")` and
  `stats::predict(..., interval = "prediction")`.
* Fixed `tl_plot_svm_boundary()` erroring with "at least two predictor
  variables required" when using `response ~ .` formulas. The function now
  resolves predictors from data column names instead of `all.vars()`, which
  does not expand `.`. Also switched from `geom_contour_filled` (which
  failed on discrete class predictions) to `geom_raster`.
* Fixed `tl_plot_svm_tuning()` passing `NULL` entries in the `ranges` list
  to `e1071::tune()`, which caused "NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call"
  errors. Tuning ranges are now built conditionally based on the kernel type.
* Fixed `tl_plot_xgboost_shap_summary()` failing with "arguments imply
  differing number of rows" when `n_samples` differed from `nrow(data)`.
  Sampling is now performed before SHAP computation so that feature values
  and SHAP values always have the same number of rows.

### Other Fixes

* Fixed classification auto-detection silently treating numeric responses
  with <= 10 unique values as classification. The response must now be a
  factor or character for classification; a helpful message is emitted when
  a low-cardinality numeric response is detected.
* Fixed `tl_check_assumptions()` crashing with "list object cannot be
  coerced to logical" when some assumption checks returned NULL (e.g.,
  when optional test packages were not installed).
* Fixed SVM default `gamma` calculation to use predictor count only
  (`1 / (ncol(data) - 1)`) instead of including the response column.
* Added missing `@return` tag to `print.tidylearn_data()`.
* Replaced deprecated ggplot2 `size` parameter with `linewidth` in all
  `geom_line()` calls across visualization, classification, PCA, DBSCAN,
  and validation plotting functions.

## Tests

* Added test suite for visualization module (26 tests) — plot dispatch,
  regression/classification plots, lift/gain charts, model comparison,
  unsupervised visualization, and Shiny dashboard.
* Added test suite for tuning module (49 tests) — `tl_default_param_grid`,
  `tl_tune_grid`, `tl_tune_random`, `tl_plot_tuning_results`, and input
  validation.
* Added test suite for diagnostics module (75 tests) — influence measures,
  influence plots, assumption checking, and outlier detection across all
  methods (IQR, z-score, Cook's, Mahalanobis).

## Code Quality

* Package-wide lint cleanup — all R source files, tests, and vignettes
  now pass lintr with zero issues
* Replaced unsafe `1:n` patterns with `seq_len()` / `seq_along()`
* Removed unused variables across the codebase
* Renamed non-snake_case variables to follow R conventions
* Added `.lintr` configuration enforcing `%>%` pipe consistency

# tidylearn 0.2.0

## New Features

### Formatted gt Tables

* New `tl_table()` dispatcher function — mirrors `plot()` but produces
  formatted `gt` tables instead of ggplot2 visualisations
* `tl_table_metrics()` — styled evaluation metrics table from `tl_evaluate()`
* `tl_table_coefficients()` — model coefficients with p-values (lm/glm) or
  sorted by magnitude (glmnet), with conditional highlighting
* `tl_table_confusion()` — confusion matrix with correct predictions
  highlighted on the diagonal
* `tl_table_importance()` — ranked feature importance with colour gradient
* `tl_table_variance()` — PCA variance explained with cumulative % coloured
* `tl_table_loadings()` — PCA loadings with diverging red–blue colour scale
* `tl_table_clusters()` — cluster sizes and mean feature values for kmeans,
  pam, clara, dbscan, and hclust models
* `tl_table_comparison()` — side-by-side multi-model comparison table
* All table functions share a consistent `gt` theme via internal
  `tl_gt_theme()` helper
* `gt` is a suggested dependency — functions error with an install message if
  `gt` is not available

### New Vignette

* Added "Reporting with tidylearn" vignette covering all plot and table
  functions

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `tl_fit_dbscan()` returning a non-existent `core_points` field
  instead of `summary` from the underlying `tidy_dbscan()` result

# tidylearn 0.1.1

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed `plot()` failing on supervised models with
  "could not find function 'tl_plot_model'" by implementing the missing
  `tl_plot_model()` and `tl_plot_unsupervised()` internal dispatchers
  ([#1](https://github.com/ces0491/tidylearn/issues/1))
* Fixed `tl_plot_actual_predicted()`, `tl_plot_residuals()`, and
  `tl_plot_confusion()` failing due to accessing a non-existent `$prediction`
  column on predict output (correct column is `$.pred`)
* Fixed the same `$prediction` column mismatch in the `tl_dashboard()`
  predictions table
